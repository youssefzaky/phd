# gaze_control

This repo contains most of the code used in my research on <b>gaze control</b>. Gaze control refers to the problem of how people 
orient (or fixate) their gaze on objects in space, which corresponds to complex coordinated movements that rotate the eyes 
and the head to align with a target in space. The code so far contains implementations of 

<ul> <li>optimal control algorithms for 1D eye and head movements </li>
      <li> a function space network model of the Superior colliculus </li> 
      <li> a 3D model of the eyes and the head </li> 
      <li> a spiking network implementation of 3D eye movements. </li>
</ul>
