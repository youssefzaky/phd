abstract = {The caudal parts of the frontal eye fields (FEF) contain smooth-pursuit related neurons. Previous studies show that most FEF pursuit neurons carry visual signals in relation to frontal spot motion and discharge before the initiation of smooth-pursuit. It has also been demonstrated that most FEF pursuit neurons discharge during vergence tracking. Accurate vergence tracking requires information about target motion-in-depth. To further understand the role of the FEF in vergence tracking and to determine whether FEF pursuit neurons carry visual information about target motion-in-depth, we examined visual and vergence eye movement-related responses of FEF pursuit neurons to sinusoidal spot motion-in-depth. During vergence tracking, most FEF pursuit neurons exhibited both vergence eye position and velocity sensitivity. Phase shifts (re target velocity) of most neurons remained virtually constant up to 1.5 Hz. About half of FEF pursuit neurons exhibited visual responses to spot motion-in-depth. The preferred directions for visual responses of most neurons were similar to those during vergence tracking. Visual responses of most of these neurons exhibited sensitivity to the velocity of spot motion-in-depth. Phase shifts of most of the responding neurons remained virtually constant up to 2.0 Hz. Neurons that exhibited visual responses in-depth were mostly separate from neurons that showed visual responses in the frontal plane. To further examine whether FEF pursuit neurons could participate in initiation of vergence tracking, we examined latencies of neuronal responses with respect to vergence eye movements induced by step target motion-in-depth. About half of FEF pursuit neurons discharged before the onset of vergence eye movements with lead times longer than 20 ms. These results together with previous observations suggest that the caudal FEF carries visual signals appropriate to be converted into motor commands for pursuit in depth and frontal plane.},

abstract = {For small objects moving smoothly in space close to the observer, smooth pursuit and vergence eye movements maintain target images near the foveae to insure high-resolution processing of visual signals about moving objects. Signals for both systems must be synthesized for pursuit-in-three-dimensions (3D). Recent studies have shown that responses of the majority of pursuit neurons in the frontal eye fields (FEF) code pursuit-in-3D. This area is known to have reciprocal connections with the medial superior temporal area (MST) where frontal pursuit neurons are found. To examine whether pursuit-in-3D signals are already present in MST and how MST neurons discharge during vergence-tracking induced by a small spot, we examined discharge of MST pursuit neurons in 2 monkeys. Of a total of 219 pursuit neurons examined during both frontal pursuit and vergence-tracking, 61\% discharged only for frontal pursuit, 18\% only for vergence-tracking, and 21\% for both. A majority of vergence-related MST neurons exhibited sensitivity to vergence eye velocity. Their discharge was maintained during brief blanking of a vergence target. About 1/3 of vergence-related MST neurons exhibited visual responses to spot motion in depth. The preferred directions for visual motion and vergence-tracking were similar in half of our population. Some of the remaining neurons showed opposite preferred directions. A significant proportion (29\%) of vergence-related neurons discharged before onset of eye movements with lead times longer than 20 ms. The results in this and previous studies indicate differences in discharge characteristics of FEF and MST pursuit neurons, suggesting different roles for the two in pursuit-in-3D.},

abstract = {The two-dimensional distribution of population activity in the superior colliculus (SC) during saccadic eye movements in the monkey was estimated using radial basis functions. To make these ensemble activity estimates, cells in the deeper layers of the SC were recorded over much of the rostrocaudal (caudal to 3.8 mm from the rostral tip), mediolateral extent of this structure. The dynamic movement field of each cell was determined at 2-ms intervals around the time of saccades for a wide variety of horizontal and oblique movements. Collicular neurons were divided into partially overlapping dorsal and ventral cell layers on the basis of recorded depth in SC. The pattern of presaccadic activity was used as an additional discriminant to sort the cells in the two layers into separate burst (dorsal) and buildup (ventral) cell classes. Rostrocaudal and medioventral cell location on the colliculus was estimated from the optimal target vector for a cell's visual response rather than from the optimal motor vector. The former technique was more reliable for locating some buildup neurons because it produced locations that compared better with the locations suggested by electrical stimulation. From the movement field data and from the estimates of each cell's anatomic location, a similar algorithm was used to compute the two-dimensional population activity in the two layers of the SC during horizontal and oblique saccades. A subset of the sample of neurons, located near the horizontal meridian of the SC, first was used to compute one-dimensional dynamic population activity estimates for horizontal saccades to allow partial comparison to previous studies. Statistical analyses on the one-dimensional data were limited to saccades of </=20 degrees. The analyses indicated that while there was a small rostrally directed shift in the center of gravity of the distributed activity in the buildup cell layer, there was little support for the theory of a systematic rostrally directed spread of the leading edge of the activity. The two-dimensional results extend the previous one-dimensional estimates of collicular activity during saccades. Discharge in the burst layer was invariant in size for all saccade vectors and symmetrically arranged about a center of gravity that did not move during saccades. The size of the active area in the buildup layer grew modestly with saccade amplitude, whereas the distribution of activity was skewed toward the rostral end of the SC for saccades larger than 10 degrees. There was a small, but consistent shift in the center of gravity of the two-dimensional activity that was directed along the horizontal meridian (for horizontal movements) or an oblique meridian (for oblique movements) of the SC. However, the spread of activity during a saccade was as large or larger in the mediolateral direction as it was in the rostral direction. The results indicate that changes in activity occur in an extended zone on the SC, and in all directions but caudal, in the buildup layer during saccades and do not support the idea of a rostrally directed spread of activity as a dynamic control mechanism for saccades. Our results and those of previous investigators of collicular population activity may be limited by stationarity concerns in that the cells used to estimate population activity were recorded in several monkeys over an extended period of time to obtain a sufficient spatial sample.},

abstract = {Although the oculomotor plant is usually modeled as a linear system, recent studies of ocular motoneuron behavior have drawn attention to the presence of significant nonlinearities. One source of these is the development of muscle force in response to changes in motoneuron firing rate. Here, we attempt to simulate the production of isometric force by the primate lateral rectus muscle in response to electrical stimulation [A. Fuchs and E. Luschei, "Development of isometric tension in simian extraocular muscle," J. Physiol., vol. 219, no. 1, pp. 155-166, 1971] by comparing four different modeling approaches. The data could be well fitted either by parameter estimation for physically based models of force production [J. Bobet, E. R. Gossen, and R. B. Stein, "A comparison of models of force production during stimulated isometric ankle dorsiflexion in humans," IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng., vol. 13, no. 4, pp. 444-451, Dec. 2005; E. Mavritsaki, N. Lepora, J. Porrill, C. H. Yeo, and P. Dean, "Response linearity determined by recruitment strategy in detailed model of nictitating membrane control," Biol. Cybern., vol. 96, no. 1, pp. 39-57, 2007], or by the application of a generic method for nonlinear system identification (the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) model). These results suggest that nonlinear system identification may be a useful method for modeling more general aspects of muscle function, and provide a basis for distributed models of motor units in extraocular muscle for understanding dynamic oculomotor control. The success of previous linear models points to the potential importance of motor unit recruitment in overcoming nonlinearities in the oculomotor plant.},

abstract = {Despite their importance for deciphering oculomotor commands, the mechanics of the extraocular muscles and orbital tissues (oculomotor plant) are poorly understood. In particular, the significance of plant nonlinearities is uncertain. Here primate plant dynamics were investigated by measuring the eye movements produced by stimulating the abducens nucleus with brief pulse trains of varying frequency. Statistical analysis of these movements indicated that the effects of stimulation lasted about 40 ms after the final pulse, after which the eye returned passively toward its position before stimulation. Behavior during the passive phase could be approximated by a linear plant model, corresponding to Voigt elements in series, with properties independent of initial eye position. In contrast, behavior during the stimulation phase revealed a sigmoidal relation between stimulation frequency and estimated steady-state tetanic tension, together with a frequency-dependent rate of tension increase, that appeared very similar to the nonlinearities previously found for isometric-force production in primate lateral rectus muscle. These results suggest that the dynamics of the oculomotor plant have an approximately linear component related to steady-state viscoelasticity and a nonlinear component related to changes in muscle activation. The latter may in part account for the nonlinear relations observed between eye-movement parameters and single-unit firing patterns in the abducens nucleus. These findings point to the importance of recruitment as a simplifying factor for motor control with nonlinear plants.},

abstract = {The dynamics and three-dimensional (3-D) properties of the primate translational vestibuloocular reflex (trVOR) for high-frequency (4-12 Hz, +/-0.3-0.4 g) lateral motion were investigated during near-target viewing at center and eccentric targets. Horizontal response gains increased with frequency and depended on target eccentricity. The larger the horizontal and vertical target eccentricity, the steeper the dependence of horizontal response gain on frequency. In addition to horizontal eye movements, robust torsional response components also were present at all frequencies. During center-target fixation, torsional response phase was opposite (anticompensatory) to that expected for an "apparent" tilt response. Instead torsional response components depended systematically on vertical-target eccentricity, increasing in amplitude when looking down and reversing phase when looking up. As a result the trVOR eye velocity vector systematically tilted away from a purely horizontal direction, through an angle that increased with vertical eccentricity with a slope of approximately 0.7. This systematic dependence of torsional eye velocity tilt on vertical eye position suggests that the trVOR might follow the 3-D kinematic requirements that have been shown to govern visually guided eye movements and near-target fixation.},

abstract = {Our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements has benefited enormously from the comparison of neuronal activity with eye movements and the quantification of these relationships with mathematical models. Although these early studies focused on horizontal and vertical eye movements, recent behavioural and modelling studies have illustrated the importance, but also the complexity, of extending previous conclusions to the problems of controlling eye and head orientation in three dimensions (3-D). An important facet in understanding 3-D eye orientation and movement has been the discovery of mobile, soft-tissue sheaths or 'pulleys' in the orbit which might influence the pulling direction of extraocular muscles. Appropriately placed pulleys could generate the eye-position-dependent tilt of the ocular rotation axes which are characteristic for eye movements which follow Listing's law. Based on such pulley models of the oculomotor plant it has recently been proposed that a simple two-dimensional (2-D) neural controller would be sufficient to generate correct 3-D eye orientation and movement. In contrast to this apparent simplification in oculomotor control, multiple behavioural observations suggest that the visuo-motor transformations, as well as the premotor circuitry for saccades, pursuit eye movements and the vestibulo-ocular reflexes, must include a neural controller which operates in 3-D, even when considering an eye plant with pulleys. This review summarizes the most recent work and ideas on this controversy. In addition, by proposing directly testable hypotheses, we point out that, in analogy to the previously successful steps towards elucidating the neural control of horizontal eye movements, we need a quantitative characterization first of motoneuron and next of premotor neuron properties in 3-D before we can succeed in gaining further insight into the neural control of 3-D motor behaviours.},

abstract = {A critical step in self-motion perception and spatial awareness is the integration of motion cues from multiple sensory organs that individually do not provide an accurate representation of the physical world. One of the best-studied sensory ambiguities is found in visual processing, and arises because of the inherent uncertainty in detecting the motion direction of an untextured contour moving within a small aperture. A similar sensory ambiguity arises in identifying the actual motion associated with linear accelerations sensed by the otolith organs in the inner ear. These internal linear accelerometers respond identically during translational motion (for example, running forward) and gravitational accelerations experienced as we reorient the head relative to gravity (that is, head tilt). Using new stimulus combinations, we identify here cerebellar and brainstem motion-sensitive neurons that compute a solution to the inertial motion detection problem. We show that the firing rates of these populations of neurons reflect the computations necessary to construct an internal model representation of the physical equations of motion.},

abstract = {The peripheral vestibular system is faced by a sensory ambiguity, where primary otolith afferents respond identically to translational (inertial) accelerations and changes in head orientation relative to gravity. Under certain conditions, this sensory ambiguity can be resolved using extra-otolith cues, including semicircular canal signals. Here we review and summarize how neurons in the vestibular nuclei, rostral fastigial nuclei, cerebellar nodulus/uvula, and thalamus respond during combinations of tilt and translation. We focus primarily on cerebellar cortex responses, as nodulus/uvula Purkinje cells reliably encode translation rather than net gravito-inertial acceleration. In contrast, neurons in the vestibular and rostral fastigial nuclei, as well as the ventral lateral and ventral posterior nuclei of the thalamus represent a continuum, with some encoding translation and some net gravito-inertial acceleration. This review also outlines how Purkinje cells use semicircular canal signals to solve the ambiguity problem and how this solution fails at low frequencies. We conclude by attempting to bridge the gap between the proposed roles of nodulus/uvula in tilt/translation discrimination and velocity storage.},

abstract = {The nodulus and uvula (lobules X and IX of the vermis) receive mossy fibers from both vestibular afferents and vestibular nuclei neurons and are thought to play a role in spatial orientation. Their properties relate to a sensory ambiguity of the vestibular periphery: otolith afferents respond identically to translational (inertial) accelerations and changes in orientation relative to gravity. Based on theoretical and behavioral evidence, this sensory ambiguity is resolved using rotational cues from the semicircular canals. Recordings from the cerebellar cortex have identified a neural correlate of the brain's ability to resolve this ambiguity in the simple spike activities of nodulus/uvula Purkinje cells. This computation, which likely involves the cerebellar circuitry and its reciprocal connections with the vestibular nuclei, results from a remarkable convergence of spatially- and temporally-aligned otolith-driven and semicircular canal-driven signals. Such convergence requires a spatio-temporal transformation of head-centered canal-driven signals into an estimate of head reorientation relative to gravity. This signal must then be subtracted from the otolith-driven estimate of net acceleration to compute inertial motion. At present, Purkinje cells in the nodulus/uvula appear to encode the output of this computation. However, how the required spatio-temporal matching takes place within the cerebellar circuitry and what role complex spikes play in spatial orientation and disorientation remains unknown. In addition, the role of visual cues in driving and/or modifying simple and complex spike activity, a process potentially critical for long-term adaptation, constitutes another important direction for future studies.},

abstract = {Because we view the world from a constantly shifting platform when our head and body move in space, vestibular and visuomotor reflexes are critical to maintain visual acuity. In contrast to the phylogenetically old rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (RVOR), it has been proposed that the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex (TVOR) represents a newly developed vestibular-driven mechanism that is important for foveal vision and stereopsis. To investigate the hypothesis that the function of the TVOR is indeed related to foveal (as opposed to full-field) image stabilization, we compared the three-dimensional ocular kinematics during lateral translation and rotational movements with those during pursuit of a small moving target in four rhesus monkeys. Specifically, we tested whether TVOR rotation axes tilt with eye position as in visually driven systems such as pursuit, or whether they stay relatively fixed in the head as in the RVOR. We found a significant dependence of three-dimensional eye velocity on eye position that was independent of viewing distance and viewing conditions (full-field, single target, or complete darkness). The slopes for this eye-position dependence averaged 0.7 +/- 0.07 for the TVOR, compared with 0.6 +/- 0.07 for visually guided pursuit eye movements and 0.18 +/- 0.09 for the RVOR. Because the torsional tilt versus vertical gaze slopes during translation were slightly higher than those during pursuit, three-dimensional eye movements during translation could partly reflect a compromise between the two different solutions for foveal gaze control, that of Listing's law and minimum velocity strategies. These results with respect to three-dimensional kinematics provide additional support for a functional difference in the two vestibular-driven mechanisms for visual stability during rotations and translations and establish clearly the functional goal of the TVOR as that for foveal visual acuity.},

In this new model the superior colliculus (SC) is represented by two layers of cells. Simulated visual inputs activate the upper layer that is connected to the lower (motor) layer with feedforward projections. Extensive lateral interconnections exist in the motor layer. The weights assigned to these interconnections are established with a recurrent back propagation algorithm and by training on a set of activity patterns obtained from neurons recorded in the monkey SC. A distributed set of connections to horizontal and vertical brainstem saccadic burst generators is trained to allow the model to make accurate saccades to randomly selected target positions. Finally, the model is able to produce accurate eye movements and realistic neural discharge for saccades evoked with a variety of experimental conditions not included in the training set (for example, averaging and express saccades).},

abstract = {Theoretical motor control predicts that because of delays in sensorimotor pathways, a neural system should exist in the brain that uses efferent copy of commands to the arm, sensory feedback, and an internal model of the dynamics of the arm to predict the future state of the hand (i.e., a forward model). We tested this theory under the hypothesis that saccadic eye movements, tracking an unseen reaching movement, would reflect the output of this state predictor. We found that in unperturbed reaching movements, saccade occurrence at any time t consistently provided an unbiased estimate of hand position at t + 196 msec. To investigate the behavior of this predictor during feedback error control, we applied 50 msec random-force perturbations to the moving hand. Saccades showed a sharp inhibition at 100 msec after perturbation. At approximately 170 msec, there was a sharp increase in saccade probabilities. These postperturbation saccades were an unbiased estimator of hand position at saccade time t + 150 msec. The ability of the brain to guide saccades to the future position of the hand failed when a force field unexpectedly changed the dynamics of the hand immediately after perturbation. The behavior of the eyes suggested that during reaching movements, the brain computes an estimate of future hand position based on an internal model that relies on real-time proprioceptive feedback. When an error occurs in reaching movements, the estimate of future hand position is recomputed. The saccade inhibition period that follows the hand perturbation may indicate the length of time it takes for this computation to take place.},

abstract = {Ocular pursuit movements allow moving objects to be tracked with a combination of smooth movements and saccades. The principal objective is to maintain smooth eye velocity close to object velocity, thus minimising retinal image motion and maintaining acuity. Saccadic movements serve to realign the image if it falls outside the fovea, the area of highest acuity. Pursuit movements are often portrayed as voluntary but their basis lies in processes that sense retinal motion and can induce eye movements without active participation. The factor distinguishing pursuit from such reflexive movements is the ability to select and track a single object when presented with multiple stimuli. The selective process requires attention, which appears to raise the gain for the selected object and/or suppress that associated with other stimuli, the resulting competition often reducing pursuit velocity. Although pursuit is essentially a feedback process, delays in motion processing create problems of stability and speed of response. This is countered by predictive processes, probably operating through internal efference copy (extra-retinal) mechanisms using short-term memory to store velocity and timing information from prior stimulation. In response to constant velocity motion, the initial response is visually driven, but extra-retinal mechanisms rapidly take over and sustain pursuit. The same extra-retinal mechanisms may also be responsible for generating anticipatory smooth pursuit movements when past experience creates expectancy of impending object motion. Similar, but more complex, processes appear to operate during periodic pursuit, where partial trajectory information is stored and released in anticipation of expected future motion, thus minimising phase errors associated with motion processing delays.},

abstract = {As a result of the availability of genetic mutant strains and development of noninvasive eye movements recording techniques, the mouse stands as a very interesting model for bridging the gap among behavioral responses, neuronal response dynamics studied in vivo, and cellular mechanisms investigated in vitro. Here we characterized the responses of individual neurons in the mouse vestibular nuclei during vestibular (horizontal whole body rotations) and full field visual stimulation. The majority of neurons ( approximately 2/3) were sensitive to vestibular stimulation but not to eye movements. During the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR), these neurons discharged in a manner comparable to the "vestibular only" (VO) neurons that have been previously described in primates. The remaining neurons [eye-movement-sensitive (ES) neurons] encoded both head-velocity and eye-position information during the VOR. When vestibular and visual stimulation were applied so that there was sensory conflict, the behavioral gain of the VOR was reduced. In turn, the modulation of sensitivity of VO neurons remained unaffected, whereas that of ES neurons was reduced. ES neurons were also modulated in response to full field visual stimulation that evoked the optokinetic reflex (OKR). Mouse VO neurons, however, unlike their primate counterpart, were not modulated during OKR. Taken together, our results show that the integration of visual and vestibular information in the mouse vestibular nucleus is limited to a subpopulation of neurons which likely supports gaze stabilization for both VOR and OKR.},

During such exploratory scan paths, gaze frequently strays from and then returns to salient features. How the brain keeps track of major end-goals and intermediate subgoals is not understood. We studied the discharge of fixation neurons of the brainstem's superior colliculus during multiple-step gaze shifts composed of a sequence of saccades made in the dark and separated by short periods of steady fixation. Cells were initially silent. As sequential gaze saccades approached the goal, firing began; its frequency increased progressively and peaked when gaze was on the remembered target location. We conclude that these fixation neurons encode the error between desired and actual gaze positions, irrespective of trajectory characteristics.},

abstract = {A fundamental question in neuroscience is how the brain transforms visual signals into accurate three-dimensional (3-D) reach commands, but surprisingly this has never been formally modeled. Here, we developed such a model and tested its predictions experimentally in humans. Our visuomotor transformation model used visual information about current hand and desired target positions to compute the visual (gaze-centered) desired movement vector. It then transformed these eye-centered plans into shoulder-centered motor plans using extraretinal eye and head position signals accounting for the complete 3-D eye-in-head and head-on-shoulder geometry (i.e., translation and rotation). We compared actual memory-guided reaching performance to the predictions of the model. By removing extraretinal signals (i.e., eye-head rotations and the offset between the centers of rotation of the eye and head) from the model, we developed a compensation index describing how accurately the brain performs the 3-D visuomotor transformation for different head-restrained and head-unrestrained gaze positions as well as for eye and head roll. Overall, subjects did not show errors predicted when extraretinal signals were ignored. Their reaching performance was accurate and the compensation index revealed that subjects accounted for the 3-D visuomotor transformation geometry. This was also the case for the initial portion of the movement (before proprioceptive feedback) indicating that the desired reach plan is computed in a feed-forward fashion. These findings show that the visuomotor transformation for reaching implements an internal model of the complete eye-to-shoulder linkage geometry and does not only rely on feedback control mechanisms. We discuss the relevance of this model in predicting reaching behavior in several patient groups.},

abstract = {To explore the possible cortical mechanisms underlying the 3-dimensional (3D) visuomotor transformation for reaching, we trained a 4-layer feed-forward artificial neural network to compute a reach vector (output) from the visual positions of both the hand and target viewed from different eye and head orientations (inputs). The emergent properties of the intermediate layers reflected several known neurophysiological findings, for example, gain field-like modulations and position-dependent shifting of receptive fields (RFs). We performed a reference frame analysis for each individual network unit, simulating standard electrophysiological experiments, that is, RF mapping (unit input), motor field mapping, and microstimulation effects (unit outputs). At the level of individual units (in both intermediate layers), the 3 different electrophysiological approaches identified different reference frames, demonstrating that these techniques reveal different neuronal properties and suggesting that a comparison across these techniques is required to understand the neural code of physiological networks. This analysis showed fixed input-output relationships within each layer and, more importantly, within each unit. These local reference frame transformation modules provide the basic elements for the global transformation; their parallel contributions are combined in a gain field-like fashion at the population level to implement both the linear and nonlinear elements of the 3D visuomotor transformation.},

abstract = {To reach for an object, one needs to know its egocentric distance (absolute depth). It remains an unresolved issue which signals are required by the brain to calculate this absolute depth information. We devised a geometric model of binocular 3D eye orientation and investigated the signals necessary to uniquely determine the depth of a non-foveated object accounting for naturalistic variations of eye and head orientations. Our model shows that, in the presence of noisy internal estimates of the ocular vergence angle, horizontal and vertical retinal disparities alone are insufficient to calculate the unique depth of a point-like target. Instead the brain must account for the 3D orientations of the eye and head. We tested the model in a behavioral experiment that involved reaches to targets in depth. Our analysis showed that a target with the same retinal disparity produced different estimates of reach depth that varied consistently with different eye and head orientations. The experimental results showed that subjects accurately account for this extraretinal information when they reach. In summary, when estimating the distance of point-like targets, all available signals about the object's location as well as body configuration are combined to provide accurate information about the object's distance.},

abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements are driven by retinal motion signals. These retinal motion signals are converted into motor commands that obey Listing's law (i.e., no accumulation of ocular torsion). The fact that smooth pursuit follows Listing's law is often taken as evidence that no explicit reference frame transformation between the retinal velocity input and the head-centered motor command is required. Such eye-position-dependent reference frame transformations between eye- and head-centered coordinates have been well-described for saccades to static targets. Here we suggest that such an eye (and head)-position-dependent reference frame transformation is also required for target motion (i.e., velocity) driving smooth pursuit eye movements. Therefore we tested smooth pursuit initiation under different three-dimensional eye positions and compared human performance to model simulations. We specifically tested if the ocular rotation axis changed with vertical eye position, if the misalignment of the spatial and retinal axes during oblique fixations was taken into account, and if ocular torsion (due to head roll) was compensated for. If no eye-position-dependent velocity transformation was used, the pursuit initiation should follow the retinal direction, independently of eye position; in contrast, a correct visuomotor velocity transformation would result in spatially correct pursuit initiation. Overall subjects accounted for all three components of the visuomotor velocity transformation, but we did observe differences in the compensatory gains between individual subjects. We concluded that the brain does perform a visuomotor velocity transformation but that this transformation was prone to noise and inaccuracies of the internal model.},

Consistent with known anatomy and physiology, its major features include excitatory connections between its output elements, nigral gating mechanisms, and an eye displacement feedback of reticular origin to recalculate the metrics of saccades to memorized targets in retinotopic coordinates. Despite the fact that it makes no use of eye position or eye velocity information, the model can account for the accuracy of saccades in double step stimulation experiments. Further, the model accounts for the effects of focal SC lesions. Finally, it accounts for the properties of saccades evoked in response to the electrical stimulation of the SC. These include the approximate size constancy of evoked saccades despite increases of stimulus intensity, the fact that the size of evoked saccades depends on the time that has elapsed from a previous saccade, the fact that staircases of saccades are evoked in response to prolonged stimuli, and the fact that the size of saccades evoked in response to the simultaneous stimulation of two SC sites is the average of the saccades that are evoked when the two sites are separately stimulated.},

The SC was divided into three zones: the rostral pole of the motor map, a small horizontal saccade zone in central SC, and a large horizontal saccade zone in caudal SC. Tracer injections into the intermediate layers of the three zones led to different patterns of silver grain deposits in and around nucleus raphe interpositus (RIP), which contains the OPNs: 1) From the rostral pole of the motor map, coarse axon branches of the crossed predorsal bundle spread medially into the RIP, branched, and terminated predominantly unilaterally over cells on the same side. 2) From the small horizontal saccade zone, the axon branches were of a finer caliber and terminated diffusely in the RIP, mainly on the same side. 3) From the large horizontal saccade zone, no terminal labeling was found within the RIP. 4) From the rostral pole of the motor map and small horizontal saccade zone, fiber branches from the ipsilateral descending pathway terminated diffusely over RIP. 5) In addition, terminal labeling in reticulospinal areas of the pons and medulla increased in parallel with the size of the saccade according to the SC motor map. The results suggest that there are multiple projections directly onto OPNs from the rostral SC but not from the caudal SC associated with large gaze shifts. The efferents from the rostral pole of the motor map may subserve the suppression of saccades during visual fixation, and those from the small horizontal saccade zone could inhibit anatagonist premotor circuits.},

We investigated the location of motoneurons supplying SIFs and MIFs in the six extraocular muscles of monkeys. Injections of retrograde tracers into eye muscles were placed either centrally, within the central SIF endplate zone; in an intermediate zone, outside the SIF endplate zone, targeting MIF endplates along the length of muscle fiber; or distally, into the myotendinous junction containing palisade endings. Central injections labeled large motoneurons within the abducens, trochlear or oculomotor nucleus, and smaller motoneurons lying mainly around the periphery of the motor nuclei. Intermediate injections labeled some large motoneurons within the motor nuclei but also labeled many peripheral motoneurons. Distal injections labeled small and medium-large peripheral neurons strongly and almost exclusively. The peripheral neurons labeled from the lateral rectus muscle surround the medial half of the abducens nucleus: from superior oblique, they form a cap over the dorsal trochlear nucleus; from inferior oblique and superior rectus, they are scattered bilaterally around the midline, between the oculomotor nucleus; from both medial and inferior rectus, they lie mainly in the C-group, on the dorsomedial border of oculomotor nucleus. In the medial rectus distal injections, a "C-group extension" extended up to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and labeled dendrites within the supraoculomotor area. We conclude that large motoneurons within the motor nuclei innervate twitch fibers, whereas smaller motoneurons around the periphery innervate nontwitch, MIF fibers. The peripheral subgroups also contain medium-large neurons which may be associated with the palisade endings of global MIFs. The role of MIFs in eye movements is unclear, but the concept of a final common pathway must now be reconsidered.},

abstract = {The posterior eye is a complex biomechanical structure. Delicate neural and vascular tissues of the retina, choroid, and optic nerve head that are critical for visual function are subjected to mechanical loading from intraocular pressure, intraocular and extraorbital muscles, and external forces on the eye. The surrounding sclera serves to counteract excessive deformation from these forces and thus to create a stable biomechanical environment for the ocular tissues. Additionally, the eye is a dynamic structure with connective tissue remodeling occurring as a result of aging and pathologies such as glaucoma and myopia. The material properties of these tissues and the distribution of stresses and strains in the posterior eye is an area of active research, relying on a combination of computational modeling, imaging, and biomechanical measurement approaches. Investigators are recognizing the increasing importance of the role of the collagen microstructure in these material properties and are undertaking microstructural measurements to drive microstructurally-informed models of ocular biomechanics. Here, we review notable findings and the consensus understanding on the biomechanics and microstructure of the posterior eye. Results from computational and numerical modeling studies and mechanical testing of ocular tissue are discussed. We conclude with some speculation as to future trends in this field.},

abstract = {Eye movement were recorded from four juvenile rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) before and after the injection of neurotoxins (kainate or ibotenate) in the region of the medial vestibular and prepositus hypoglossi nuclei, an area hypothesized to be the locus of the neural integrator for horizontal eye movement commands. Eye movements were measured in the head-restrained animal by the magnetic field/eye-coil method. The monkeys were trained to follow visual targets. A chamber implanted over a trephine hole in the skull permitted recordings to be made in the brain stem with metal microelectrodes. The abducens nuclei were located and used as a reference point for subsequent neurotoxin injections through cannulas. The effects of these lesions on fixation, vestibuloocular and optokinetic responses, and smooth pursuit were compared with predicted oculomotor anomalies caused by a loss of the neural integrator. Kainate and ibotenate did not create permanent lesions in this region of the brain stem. All the eye movements returned toward normal over the course of a few days to 2 wk. Histological examination revealed that the cannula tips were mainly located between the vestibular and prepositus hypoglossi nuclei, in their rostral 2 mm, bordered rostrally by the abducens nuclei. Dense gliosis clearly demarcated the cannula tracks, but for most injections there were no surrounding regions of neuronal loss. Thus the eye movement disorders were due to a reversible, not a permanent, lesion. The time constant for the neural integrator was determined from the velocity of the centripetal drift of the eyes just after an eccentric saccade in total darkness. For intact animals this time constant was greater than 20 s. Shortly after bilateral injections of neurotoxin, the time constant began to decrease and reached a minimum of 200 ms; every horizontal saccade was followed by a rapid centripetal drift with a time constant of approximately 200 ms. For vertical eye movements, in this acute phase, the time constant was approximately 2.5 s. The vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) was drastically changed by the lesions. A step of constant head velocity in total darkness evoked a step change in eye position rather than in velocity. In the absence of the neural integrator, the step velocity command from the canal afferents was not integrated to produce a ramp of eye position (normal slow phases); rather this signal was relayed directly to the motoneurons and caused a step in eye position. The per- and postrotatory decay of the head velocity signal was decreased to 5-6 s indicating that vestibular velocity storage was also impaired.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The superior colliculus (SC) is well known for its role in the motor control of saccades. Recent work has shown that it also plays a role in the selection of saccades, but a causal role in the process of target selection has not been demonstrated. We applied subthreshold microstimulation to the SC while monkeys performed a task requiring them to select a stimulus as the target for a pursuit or saccade movement. Stimulation increased the proportion of selections toward the stimulus that appeared contralateral to the site of stimulation and also decreased their latencies. For pursuit, this stimulation-induced contralateral response bias was with respect to the initial target location and not the direction of eye movement, demonstrating a causal effect on target choice distinct from any effect on motor preparation. These results show that the SC helps decide the object of the next movement, beyond its traditional responsibility of saccade production.},

abstract = {The generation of primate smooth pursuit eye movements involves two processes. One process transforms the direction and speed of target motion into a motor command and the other regulates the strength, or "gain," of the visual-motor transformation. We have conducted a behavioral analysis to identify the signals that modulate the internal gain of pursuit. To test whether the modulatory signals are related to eye velocity in the orbit or in the world (gaze velocity), we used brief perturbations of target motion to probe the gain of pursuit during tracking conditions that used head rotation to dissociate eye and gaze velocity. We found that the responses to perturbations varied primarily as a function of gaze velocity. To further understand the gaze velocity signals that control internal pursuit gain, we used adaptive modification of the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) to dissociate physical gaze velocity from the component of gaze velocity that is driven by visual inputs. After VOR adaptation, perturbation responses were altered; the smallest perturbation responses now occurred during tracking conditions that required nonzero physical gaze velocity. However, perturbation responses during tracking conditions that mimicked the modified VOR were still enhanced relative to those obtained during fixation. We conclude that the signals that modulate the internal gain of pursuit are modified by VOR adaptation so that they are rendered intermediate between physical and visually driven gaze velocity. Similar changes in the gaze velocity signal have been reported in the cerebellar floccular complex following adaptive modification of the VOR and could be present in other brain areas that carry putative gaze velocity signals.},

abstract = {In the 19th century, Donders observed that only one three-dimensional eye orientation is used for each gaze direction. Listing's law further specifies that the full set of eye orientation vectors forms a plane, whereas the equivalent Donders' law for the head, the Fick strategy, specifies a twisted two-dimensional range. Surprisingly, despite considerable research and speculation, the biological reasons for choosing one such range over another remain obscure. In the current study, human subjects performed head-free gaze shifts between visual targets while wearing pinhole goggles. During fixations, the head orientation range still obeyed Donders' law, but in most subjects, it immediately changed from the twisted Fick-like range to a flattened Listing-like range. Further controls showed that this was not attributable to loss of binocular vision or increased range of head motion, nor was it attributable to blocked peripheral vision; when subjects pointed a helmet-mounted laser toward targets (a task with goggle-like motor demands but normal vision), the head followed Listing's law even more closely. Donders' law of the head only broke down (in favor of a "minimum-rotation strategy") when head motion was dissociated from gaze. These behaviors could not be modeled using current "Donders' operators" but were readily simulated nonholonomically, i.e., by modulating head velocity commands as a function of position and task. We conclude that the gaze control system uses such velocity rules to shape Donders' law on a moment-to-moment basis, not primarily to satisfy perceptual or anatomic demands, but rather for motor optimization; the Fick strategy optimizes the role of the head as a platform for eye movement, whereas Listing's law optimizes rapid control of the eye (or head) as a gaze pointer.

abstract = {Ballistic movements like saccades require the brain to generate motor commands without the benefit of sensory feedback. Despite this, saccades are remarkably accurate. Theory suggests that this accuracy arises because the brain relies on an internal forward model that monitors the motor commands, predicts their sensory consequences, and corrects eye trajectory midflight. If control of saccades relies on a forward model, then the forward model should adapt whenever its predictions fail to match sensory feedback at the end of the movement. Using optimal feedback control theory, we predicted how this adaptation should alter saccade trajectories. We trained subjects on a paradigm in which the horizontal target jumped vertically during the saccade. With training, the final position of the saccade moved toward the second target. However, saccades became increasingly curved, i.e., suboptimal, as oculomotor commands were corrected on-line to steer the eye toward the second target. The adaptive response had two components: (1) the motor commands that initiated the saccades changed slowly, aiming the saccade closer to the jumped target. The adaptation of these earliest motor commands displayed little forgetting during the rest periods. (2) Late in saccade trajectory, another adaptive response steered it still closer to the jumped target, producing curvature. Adaptation of these late motor commands showed near-complete forgetting during the rest periods. The two components adapted at different timescales, with the late-acting component displaying much faster rates. It appears that in controlling saccades, the brain relies on an internal feedback that has the characteristics of a fast-adapting forward model.},

We recorded from superior colliculus fixation neurons (SCFNs) that fired tonically during fixation and were silent during gaze shifts. When we briefly (<or=700 ms) interrupted gaze shifts by transiently braking head movements, SCFNs fired steadily during brake-induced gaze immobility, and their mean frequency was inversely related to the remaining distance between current gaze position and the target. After head release, a corrective gaze saccade brought gaze on the unseen goal, and SCFN firing frequency peaked. The results support gaze feedback control and show that the SC is part of a network that encodes, during orientation, the distance between eye and target, irrespective of gaze trajectory characteristics.},

abstract = {We have examined the underlying coordinate frame for pursuit learning by testing how broadly learning generalizes to different retinal loci and directions of target motion. Learned changes in pursuit were induced using double steps of target speed. Monkeys tracked a target that stepped obliquely away from the point of fixation, then moved smoothly either leftward or rightward. In each experimental session, we adapted the response to targets moving in one direction across one locus of the visual field by changing target speed during the initial catch-up saccade. Learning occurred in both presaccadic and postsaccadic eye velocity. The changes were specific to the adapted direction and did not generalize to the opposite direction of pursuit. To test the spatial scale of learning, we examined the responses to targets that moved across different parts of the visual field at the same velocity as the learning targets. Learning generalized partially to motion presented at untrained locations in the visual field, even those across the vertical meridian. Experiments with two sets of learning trials showed interference between learning at different sites in the visual field, suggesting that pursuit learning is not capable of spatial specificity. Our findings are consistent with the previous suggestions that pursuit learning is encoded in an intermediate representation that is neither strictly sensory nor strictly motor. Our data add the constraint that the site or sites of pursuit learning must process visual information on a fairly large spatial scale that extends across the horizontal and vertical meridians.},

abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements are guided by visual feedback and are surprisingly accurate despite the time delay between visual input and motor output. Previous models have reproduced the accuracy of pursuit either by using elaborate visual signals or by adding sources of motor feedback. Our goal was to constrain what types of signals drive pursuit by obtaining data that would discriminate between these two modeling approaches, represented by the "image motion model" and the "tachometer feedback" model. Our first set of experiments probed the visual properties of pursuit with brief square-pulse and sine-wave perturbations of target velocity. Responses to pulse perturbations increased almost linearly with pulse amplitude, while responses to sine wave perturbations showed strong saturation with increasing stimulus amplitude. The response to sine wave perturbations was strongly dependent on the baseline image velocity at the time of the perturbation. Responses were much smaller if baseline image velocity was naturally large, or was artificially increased by superimposing sine waves on pulse perturbations. The image motion model, but not the tachometer feedback model, could reproduce these features of pursuit. We used a revision of the image motion model that was, like the original, sensitive to both image velocity and image acceleration. Due to a saturating nonlinearity, the sensitivity to image acceleration declined with increasing image velocity. Inclusion of this nonlinearity was motivated by our experimental results, was critical in accounting for the responses to perturbations, and provided an explanation for the unexpected stability of pursuit in the presence of perturbations near the resonant frequency. As an emergent property, the revised image motion model was able to reproduce the frequency and damping of oscillations recorded during artificial feedback delays. Our second set of experiments replicated prior recordings of pursuit responses to multiple-cycle sine wave perturbations, presented over a range of frequencies. The image motion model was able to reproduce the responses to sine wave perturbations across all frequencies, while the tachometer feedback model failed at high frequencies. These failures resulted from the absence of image acceleration signals in the tachometer model. We conclude that visual signals related to image acceleration are important in driving pursuit eye movements and that the nonlinearity of these signals provides stability. Smooth pursuit thus illustrates that a plausible neural strategy for combating natural delays in sensory feedback is to employ information about the derivative of the sensory input.},

abstract = {The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) exacts compensatory movements of the extraocular muscles in response to stimulation of the semicircular canals to allow gaze fixation during head movements. In this study, the spatial relationships of these muscles and canals were investigated to assess their relative alignments in mammalian species commonly used in studies of the VOR. The head region of each specimen was scanned using magnetic resonance imaging and 28 anatomical landmarks were recorded from the images to define the six extraocular muscles and the anatomical planes of the three semicircular canals. The vector rotation of a semicircular canal that does not stimulate either of its two sister canals, referred to as the prime direction, was also calculated as an estimate of the maximal response plane. Significant misalignments were found between the extraocular muscles and the canals by which they are principally stimulated in most of the species under study. The deviations from parallel orientation were most pronounced in the human and rabbit samples. There were also significant departures from orthogonality between the semicircular canals in most species. Only the guinea pig displayed no significant difference from 90 degrees in any of its three inter-canal angles, although humans and rabbits deviated from orthogonality in just one semicircular canal pair - the anterior and posterior canals. The prime directions were found to deviate considerably from the anatomical canal planes (by over 20 degrees in rats). However, these deviations were not always compensatory, i.e. prime planes were not always more closely aligned with the muscle planes. Results support the view that the vestibular frame remains relatively stable and that the spatial mismatch with the extraocular co-ordinate frame is principally driven by realignment of the muscles as a result of changes in the position of the orbits within the skull (orbital convergence and frontation).},

abstract = {Coordinate systems are a central issue in computational neuroscience: are they explicitly represented at some reductive level of brain function, and if so, are they only trivial products of associated anatomic geometries? This investigation examined these questions in the neural network that holds eye position, the so-called oculomotor integrator. Since neural activity in the integrator is behaviorally constrained by Listing's law to encode horizontal and vertical eye positions within Listing's plane and zero rotation about the orthogonal torsional axis, it was hypothesized that any integrator coordinate system would be developmentally predisposed to align with Listing's plane. A test for this hypothesis was developed with the use of a kinematically correct model of the three-dimensional saccade generator. Three mathematical integrators were used to represent the neuron populations that control torsional, vertical, and horizontal eye position. Simulated failure of the torsional and vertical integrators produced eye position drift that was parallel to the horizontal plane containing the intrinsic coordinate axes for these components. Furthermore, this drift settled toward a resting range parallel to the intrinsic vertical coordinate axis (for horizontal rotation). To experimentally identify these intrinsic population coordinates, three-dimensional eye positions were measured in four Macaca fascicularis after injection of muscimol into the mesencephalic interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), a technique that disrupts the torsional and vertical integrators (Crawford et al., 1991). INC inactivation produced exponential, position-dependent decay in vertical and torsional eye position. There was no position-dependent horizontal drift, but in the original coordinate system (defined arbitrarily by the measurement apparatus) there was a constant-direction horizontal drift. However, this extraneous horizontal drift was eliminated when the data were transformed into a coordinate system that aligned with Listing's plane. The direction of torsional drift correlated well (r = 0.85), across all experiments, with the normal to Listing's plane. On average, these two directions were only 0.06 degrees from perfect alignment. In contrast, drift direction did not correlate with stereotaxic coordinates (r = 0.10). Furthermore, the drift settled toward a range parallel to and correlated with Listing's plane (r = 0.94), whereas this range did not correlate well with stereotaxic coordinates (r = 0.02). On average, the resting range was aligned within 0.98 degrees of Listing's plane. Finally, this resting range was near orthogonal (average 91.9 degrees across all experiments) to the direction of torsional drift. These results show that integrator cell populations use an orthogonal, craniotopic coordinate system that aligns with Listing's plane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to describe the neural constraints on three-dimensional (3-D) orientations of the eye in space (Es), head in space (Hs), and eye in head (Eh) during visual fixations in the monkey and the control strategies used to implement these constraints during head-free gaze saccades. Dual scleral search coil signals were used to compute 3-D orientation quaternions, two-dimensional (2-D) direction vectors, and 3-D angular velocity vectors for both the eye and head in three monkeys during the following visual tasks: radial to/from center, repetitive horizontal, nonrepetitive oblique, random (wide 2-D range), and random with pin-hole goggles. Although 2-D gaze direction (of Es) was controlled more tightly than the contributing 2-D Hs and Eh components, the torsional standard deviation of Es was greater (mean 3.55 degrees ) than Hs (3.10 degrees ), which in turn was greater than Eh (1.87 degrees ) during random fixations. Thus the 3-D Es range appeared to be the byproduct of Hs and Eh constraints, resulting in a pseudoplanar Es range that was twisted (in orthogonal coordinates) like the zero torsion range of Fick coordinates. The Hs fixation range was similarly Fick-like, whereas the Eh fixation range was quasiplanar. The latter Eh range was maintained through exquisite saccade/slow phase coordination, i.e., during each head movement, multiple anticipatory saccades drove the eye torsionally out of the planar range such that subsequent slow phases drove the eye back toward the fixation range. The Fick-like Hs constraint was maintained by the following strategies: first, during purely vertical/horizontal movements, the head rotated about constantly oriented axes that closely resembled physical Fick gimbals, i.e., about head-fixed horizontal axes and space-fixed vertical axes, respectively (although in 1 animal, the latter constraint was relaxed during repetitive horizontal movements, allowing for trajectory optimization). However, during large oblique movements, head orientation made transient but dramatic departures from the zero-torsion Fick surface, taking the shortest path between two torsionally eccentric fixation points on the surface. Moreover, in the pin-hole goggle task, the head-orientation range flattened significantly, suggesting a task-dependent default strategy similar to Listing's law. These and previous observations suggest two quasi-independent brain stem circuits: an oculomotor 2-D to 3-D transformation that coordinates anticipatory saccades with slow phases to uphold Listing's law, and a flexible "Fick operator" that selects head motor error; both nested within a dynamic gaze feedback loop.},

abstract = {Primate head-free saccade generator implements a desired (post-VOR) eye position command by anticipating intended head motion. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2811-2816, 1997. When we glance between objects, the brain ultimately controls gaze direction in space. However, it is currently unclear how this is allocated into separate commands for eye and head movement. To determine the role of desired final eye position commands, and their coordination with intended head movement, we trained three monkeys to make large gaze shifts while wearing opaque goggles with a monocular 8 degrees aperture. Animals eventually developed a new set of context-dependent eye-head coordination strategies, in particular expanding the head range and compressing the eye-in-head range toward the aperture (while wearing the goggles). However, when we shifted the location of the aperture to a different subsection of the normal head-free oculomotor range (by covering the original aperture and creating a new one), eye-head saccades failed to acquire visual targets, because they continued to drive the eye ultimately toward the now occluded original aperture. Even when a head-stationary saccade acquired the new aperture, subsequent head-free saccades drove the eye eccentrically toward a point that anticipated the intended head movement, such that the subsequent vestibuloocular reflex slow phase brought the eye onto the location of the original aperture. Animals could only acquire the new aperture consistently after several days of retraining. These results suggest that 1) eye-head coordination is achieved by a plastic, context-dependent neural operator that uses information about initial eye/head position and intended movement to compute desired combinations of final eye/head position and 2) acquisition of these positions involves sophisticated anticipatory compensations for subsequent movement components, akin to those observed previously in complex oral and manual behaviors.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to identify and model the three-dimensional (3-D) geometric transformations required for accurate saccades to distant visual targets from arbitrary initial eye positions. In abstract 2-D models, target displacement in space, retinal error (RE), and saccade vectors are trivially interchangeable. However, in real 3-D space, RE is a nontrivial function of objective target displacement and 3-D eye position. To determine the physiological implications of this, a visuomotor "lookup table" was modeled by mapping the horizontal/vertical components of RE onto the corresponding vector components of eye displacement in Listing's plane. This provided the motor error (ME) command for a 3-D displacement-feedback loop. The output of this loop controlled an oculomotor plant that mechanically implemented the position-dependent saccade axis tilts required for Listing's law. This model correctly maintained Listing's law but was unable to correct torsional position deviations from Listing' s plane. Moreover, the model also generated systematic errors in saccade direction (as a function of eye position components orthogonal to RE), predicting errors in final gaze direction of up to 25 degrees in the oculomotor range. Plant modifications could not solve these problems, because the intrisic oculomotor input-output geometry forced a fixed visuomotor mapping to choose between either accuracy or Listing's law. This was reflected internally by a sensorimotor divergence between input-defined visual displacement signals (inherently 2-D and defined in reference to the eye) and output-defined motor displacement signals (inherently 3-D and defined in reference to the head). These problems were solved by rotating RE by estimated 3-D eye position (i.e., a reference frame transformation), inputting the result into a 2-D-to-3-D "Listing's law operator," and then finally subtracting initial 3-D eye position to yield the correct ME. This model was accurate and upheld Listing's law from all initial positions. Moreover, it suggested specific experiments to invasively distinguish visual and motor displacement codes, predicting a systematic position dependence in the directional tuning of RE versus a fixed-vector tuning in ME. We conclude that visual and motor displacement spaces are geometrically distinct such that a fixed visual-motor mapping will produce systematic and measurable behavioral errors. To avoid these errors, the brain would need to implement both a 3-D position-dependent reference frame transformation and nontrivial 2-D-to-3-D transformation. Furthermore, our simulations provide new experimental paradigms to invasively identify the physiological progression of these spatial transformations by reexamining the position-dependent geometry of displacement code directions in the superior colliculus, cerebellum, and various cortical visuomotor areas.},

abstract = {Primate head-free saccade generator implements a desired (post-VOR) eye position command by anticipating intended head motion. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2811-2816, 1997. When we glance between objects, the brain ultimately controls gaze direction in space. However, it is currently unclear how this is allocated into separate commands for eye and head movement. To determine the role of desired final eye position commands, and their coordination with intended head movement, we trained three monkeys to make large gaze shifts while wearing opaque goggles with a monocular 8 degrees aperture. Animals eventually developed a new set of context-dependent eye-head coordination strategies, in particular expanding the head range and compressing the eye-in-head range toward the aperture (while wearing the goggles). However, when we shifted the location of the aperture to a different subsection of the normal head-free oculomotor range (by covering the original aperture and creating a new one), eye-head saccades failed to acquire visual targets, because they continued to drive the eye ultimately toward the now occluded original aperture. Even when a head-stationary saccade acquired the new aperture, subsequent head-free saccades drove the eye eccentrically toward a point that anticipated the intended head movement, such that the subsequent vestibuloocular reflex slow phase brought the eye onto the location of the original aperture. Animals could only acquire the new aperture consistently after several days of retraining. These results suggest that 1) eye-head coordination is achieved by a plastic, context-dependent neural operator that uses information about initial eye/head position and intended movement to compute desired combinations of final eye/head position and 2) acquisition of these positions involves sophisticated anticipatory compensations for subsequent movement components, akin to those observed previously in complex oral and manual behaviors.},

abstract = {1. The vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) was examined in four alert monkeys during rotations of the head about torsional, vertical, horizontal, and intermediate axes. Eye positions and axes were recorded in three dimensions (3-D). Visual targets were used to optimize gaze stabilization. 2. Axes of eye rotation during slow phases showed small but systematic deviations from collinearity with the axes of head rotation. These noncollinearities apparently resulted from vector summation of torsional, vertical, and horizontal VOR components with different gains. 3. VOR gain was lowest about a head-fixed torsional axis that was correlated with the primary gaze direction, as determined by Listing's law for saccades. As a result, rotation of the head about a partially torsional axis produced noncollinear slow phases, with axes that tilted toward Listing's plane. 4. During slow phases, eye position changed not only in the direction of rotation, but also systematically in other directions. Even axes of eye rotation within Listing's plane caused eye position to move out of the plane to a torsional position that was then held. Thus Listing's law for saccades cannot be a product of plant mechanics. 5. VOR slow phases were simulated with the use of a model that incorporated 3-D rotational kinematics into the indirect path and the oculomotor plant. This demonstrated that the observed pattern of position changes is the expected consequence of rotating the eye about a fixed axis and that to hold these positions the indirect path must employ a 3-D velocity-to-position transformation. 6. Quick phases not only corrected the violations of Listing's law produced by slow phases but anticipated them by directing the eye toward a plane rotated in the direction of head rotation. This was modeled by inputting the vestibular signal to a Listing's law operator that is shared by the quick phase and saccadic systems.},

abstract = {Much of the central nervous system is involved in visuomotor transformations for goal-directed gaze and reach movements. These transformations are often described in terms of stimulus location, gaze fixation, and reach endpoints, as viewed through the lens of translational geometry. Here, we argue that the intrinsic (primarily rotational) 3-D geometry of the eye-head-reach systems determines the spatial relationship between extrinsic goals and effector commands, and therefore the required transformations. This approach provides a common theoretical framework for understanding both gaze and reach control. Combined with an assessment of the behavioral, neurophysiological, imaging, and neuropsychological literature, this framework leads us to conclude that (a) the internal representation and updating of visual goals are dominated by gaze-centered mechanisms, but (b) these representations must then be transformed as a function of eye and head orientation signals into effector-specific 3-D movement commands.},

abstract = {Although numerous investigations have probed the status of the vestibuloocular (VOR) during gaze shifts, its exact status remains strangely elusive. The goal of the present study was to precisely evaluate the dynamics of VOR suppression immediately before, throughout, and just after gaze shifts. A torque motor was used to apply rapid (100 degrees/s), short-duration (20-30 ms) horizontal head perturbations in three Rhesus monkeys. The status of the VOR elicited by this transient head perturbation was first compared during 15, 40, and 60 degrees gaze shifts. The level of VOR suppression just after gaze-shift onset (40 ms) increased with gaze-shift amplitude in two monkeys, approaching values of 80 and 35\%. In contrast, in the third monkey, the VOR was not significantly attenuated for all gaze-shift amplitudes. The time course of VOR attenuation was then studied in greater detail for all three monkeys by imposing the same short-duration head perturbations 40, 100, and 150 ms after the onset of 60 degrees gaze shifts. Overall we found a consistent trend, in which VOR suppression was maximal early in the gaze shift and progressively recovered to reach normal values near gaze-shift end. However, the high variability across subjects prevented establishing a unifying description of the absolute level and time course of VOR suppression during gaze shifts. We propose that differences in behavioral strategies may account, at least in part, for these differences between subjects.},

abstract = {Rotations of the line of sight are mainly implemented by coordinated motion of the eyes and head. Here, we propose a model for the kinematics of three-dimensional (3-D) head-unrestrained gaze-shifts. The model was designed to account for major principles in the known behavior, such as gaze accuracy, spatiotemporal coordination of saccades with vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), relative eye and head contributions, the non-commutativity of rotations, and Listing's and Fick constraints for the eyes and head, respectively. The internal design of the model was inspired by known and hypothesized elements of gaze control physiology. Inputs included retinocentric location of the visual target and internal representations of initial 3-D eye and head orientation, whereas outputs were 3-D displacements of eye relative to the head and head relative to shoulder. Internal transformations decomposed the 2-D gaze command into 3-D eye and head commands with the use of three coordinated circuits: (1) a saccade generator, (2) a head rotation generator, (3) a VOR predictor. Simulations illustrate that the model can implement: (1) the correct 3-D reference frame transformations to generate accurate gaze shifts (despite variability in other parameters), (2) the experimentally verified constraints on static eye and head orientations during fixation, and (3) the experimentally observed 3-D trajectories of eye and head motion during gaze-shifts. We then use this model to simulate how 2-D eye-head coordination strategies interact with 3-D constraints to influence 3-D orientations of the eye-in-space, and the implications of this for spatial vision.},

abstract = {Coordinating the movements of different body parts is a challenging process for the central nervous system because of several problems. Four of these main difficulties are: first, moving one part can move others; second, the parts can have different dynamics; third, some parts can have different motor goals; and fourth, some parts may be perturbed by outside forces. Here, we propose a novel approach for the control of linked systems with feedback loops for each part. The proximal parts have separate goals, but critically the most distal part has only the common goal. We apply this new control policy to eye-head coordination in two-dimensions, specifically head-unrestrained gaze saccades. Paradoxically, the hierarchical structure has controllers for the gaze and the head, but not for the eye (the most distal part). Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed control structure reproduces much of the published empirical data about gaze movements, e.g., it compensates for perturbations, accurately reaches goals for gaze and head from arbitrary initial positions, simulates the nine relationships of the head-unrestrained main sequence, and reproduces observations from lesion and single-unit recording experiments. We conclude by showing how our model can be easily extended to control structures with more linked segments, such as the control of coordinated eye on head on trunk movements.},

abstract = {Clinical and experimental data indicate that damage to the cerebellar vermis results in permanent loss of saccadic accuracy. Models of saccade production therefore need to provide a role for the cerebellum. It has been proposed that the vermis adjusts the gain of the saccadic internal feedback loop in response to information about the amplitude of the intended saccade. A model of how the fastigial nuclei (through which vermal output is channelled) influence brainstem saccadic circuitry to achieve this effect was constructed in three stages. (1) The brainstem was represented by a version of Robinson's internal feedback model, which relates excitatory burst neuron discharge to horizontal saccade dynamics. (2) The original model was lesioned to simulate the effects of bilateral inactivation of the fastigial nuclei, namely slow hypermetric saccades. This required reducing the synaptic weight of the internal feedback pathway, and lowering the gain of the excitatory burst neurons. The resultant brainstem-only model served as a preparation for testing the effects of neuronal discharge patterns within the fastigial nuclei. (3) These discharge patterns were simulated using measurements from recent electrophysiological studies. It was found that saccadic accuracy and normal dynamics were restored in the model if the simulated burst from neurons in the contralateral fastigial nucleus were subtracted from the feedback signal (i.e. added to the command signal) early in the saccade, and the burst from neurons in the ipsilateral fastigial nucleus were added to the feedback signal later in the saccade. This pattern corresponds to the observed timing of neuronal bursts in the fastigial nuclei, and accounts qualitatively for the effects of unilateral stimulation and inactivation of both the fastigial nuclei and the cerebellar vermis. This method of producing accurate saccades also contributes to time optimal control, by increasing both saccadic acceleration and deceleration. Appropriate timing of burst onset and duration in the fastigial nuclei is essential for these roles. Evidence concerning the effects of cerebellar damage on fast movements of other parts of the body suggests that the cerebellum may use similar strategies for controlling a wide range of simple movements.},

abstract = {Abstract Saccadic accuracy requires that the control signal sent to the motor neurons must be the right size to bring the fovea to the target, whatever the initial position of the eyes (and corresponding state of the eye muscles). Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that the basic machinery for generating saccadic eye movements, located in the brainstem, is not accurate: learning to make accurate saccades requires cerebellar circuitry located in the posterior vermis and fastigial nucleus. How do these two circuits interact to achieve adaptive control of saccades? A model of this interaction is described, based on Kawato's principle of feedback-error-learning. Its three components were (1) a simple controller with no knowledge of initial eye position, corresponding to the superior colliculus; (2) Robinson's internal feedback model of the saccadic burst generator, corresponding to preoculomotor areas in the brain-stem; and (3) Albus's Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMK), a neural net model of the cerebellum. The connections between these components were (I) the simple feedback controller passed a (usually inaccurate) command to the pulse generator, and (2) a copy of this command to the CMAC; (3) the CMAC combined the copy with information about initial eye position to (4) alter the gain on the pulse generator's internal feedback loop, thereby adjusting the size of burst sent to the motor neurons. (5) If the saccade were inaccurate, an error signal from the feedback controller adjusted the weights in the CMAC. It was proposed that connection (2) corresponds to the mossy fiber projection from superior colliculus to oculomotor vermis via the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and connection (5) to the climbing fiber projection from superior colliculus to the oculomotor vermis via the inferior olive. Plausible initialization values were chosen so that the system produced hypometric saccades (as do human infants) at the start of learning, and position-dependent hypermetric saccades when the cerebellum was removed. Simulations for horizontal eye movements showed that accurate saccades from any starting position could be learned rapidly, even if the error signal conveyed only whether the initial saccade were too large or too small. In subsequent tests the model adapted realistically both to simulated weakening of the eye muscles, and to intrasaccadic displacement of the target, thereby mimicking saccadic plasticity in adults. The architecture of the model may therefore offer a functional explanation of hitherto mysterious tectocerebellar projections, and a framework for investigating in greater detail how the cerebellum adaptively controls saccadic accuracy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows that the paths of recti extraocular muscle (EOM) bellies remain fixed in the orbit during large ocular rotations and across large surgical transpositions of their insertions. These findings imply that recti EOMs pass through pulleys coupled to the orbit and anterior to the muscle bellies, because the insertions must move with the globe. The present study was conducted to locate anatomically and to characterize histologically the pulley tissues.

METHODS: High-resolution MRI images were collected from volunteers, using multiple gaze directions to infer the locations of, and occasionally to visualize, recti EOM pulleys. Fresh cadaver orbits were exenterated and dissected to evaluate mechanical and structural properties of the orbital connective tissues. Lipid was cleared from whole specimens to reveal tissue relationships. Other specimens were selectively step- and serial-sectioned for histochemical and immunohistochemical staining.

RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated dense connective tissue structures within posterior Tenon's fascia near the equator of the globe adjacent to the recti EOMs. Histochemistry showed these structures to be pulleys--fibroelastic EOM sleeves consisting of dense bands of collagen and elastin, suspended from the orbit and adjacent EOM sleeves by bands of similar composition. A monoclonal antibody to human smooth muscle alpha-actin demonstrated substantial smooth muscle in the pulley suspensions and in posterior Tenon's fascia. Tenon's fascia itself was seen to be suspended at its periphery from the orbital walls like a drumhead.

CONCLUSIONS: The human orbit contains specialized musculofibroelastic tissues in and just posterior to Tenon's fascia that serve as compliant pulleys and determine the pulling directions of recti EOMs. In this sense, the pulleys are the functional origins of the recti EOMs and are determinants of ocular motility.},

This study was conducted to investigate the relationship of orbital and global EOM layers to pulleys and kinematic implications of this anatomy.

METHODS: High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to define the anterior paths of rectus EOMs, as influenced by gaze direction in living subjects. Pulley tissues were examined at cadaveric dissections and surgical exposures. Human and monkey orbits were step and serially sectioned for histologic staining to distinguish EOM fiber layers in relationship to pulleys.

RESULTS: MRI consistently demonstrated gaze-related shifts in the anteroposterior locations of human EOM path inflections, as well as shifts in components of the pulleys themselves. Histologic studies of human and monkey orbits confirmed gross examinations and surgical exposures to indicate that the orbital layer of each rectus EOM inserts on its corresponding pulley, rather than on the globe. Only the global layer of the EOM inserts on the sclera. This dual insertion was visualized in vivo by MRI in human horizontal rectus EOMs.

CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose the active-pulley hypothesis: By dual insertions the global layer of each rectus EOM rotates the globe while the orbital layer inserts on its pulley to position it linearly and thus influence the EOM's rotational axis. Pulley locations may also be altered in convergence. This overall arrangement is parsimoniously suited to account for numerous aspects of ocular dynamics and kinematics, including Listing's law.},

abstract = {Important aspects of ocular kinematics relate to the geometric configuration of extraocular muscles (EOMs). The orbital layer of each rectus EOM inserts on a connective tissue ring called a pulley that deflects the EOM path. Global layer fibers of each EOM pass through the pulley to insert on the sclera. The orbital layer thus controls linear translation of the pulley, regulating the EOM's pulling direction, while the global layer rotates the eye. The active pulley hypothesis (APH) states that pulleys are actively positioned to regulate ocular kinematics. The coordinated control postulate of the APH proposes that during conjugate visually guided eye movements, rectus pulleys move the same anteroposterior distance as their insertions, but the inferior oblique pulley moves with vertical gaze by half the amount as the inferior rectus insertion. These motions, observable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), shift the pulling directions of these EOMs by half the ocular angle, mechanically implementing a 'linear oculomotor plant' appearing mathematically commutative to the brain and consistent with Listing's Law of ocular torsion. In the non-converged state with the head upright and stationary, rectus pulleys move little transverse to the EOM axes. During convergence and during the static torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex, MRI shows that the rectus pulley array rotates around the line of sight. Oblique EOM orbital layers may implement this shift.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) now enables precise visualization of the mechanical state of the living human orbit. Resulting insights have motivated histological re-examination of human and simian orbits, providing abundant consistent evidence for the active pulley hypothesis, a re-formulation of ocular motor physiology. Each extraocular muscle (EOM) consists of a global layer (GL) contiguous with the tendon and inserting on the eyeball, and a similar-sized orbital layer (OL) inserting on a connective tissue ring forming the EOM pulley. The pulley controls the EOM path and serves as the EOM's functional origin. Activity of the OL positions the pulley along each rectus EOM to assure that its pulling direction shifts by half the change in ocular orientation, the half-angle behavior characteristic of a linear ocular motor plant. Half-angle behavior is equivalent to Listing's law of ocular torsion, and makes 3-D ocular rotations effectively commutative. Pulleys are configured to maintain oblique EOM paths orthogonal to half-angle behavior, and violate Listing's law during the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Rectus pulley positions shift during convergence, facilitating stereopsis. Innervations, fiber types, and metabolism of the OL and GL differ, consistent with the elastic loading of the former, and viscous loading of the latter. Disorders of the location and stability of rectus pulleys are associated with predictable patterns of incomitant strabismus that may mimic cranial nerve palsies. Surgical interventions improve defective pulley function. Understanding of ocular motor control requires characterization of the behavior of the EOM pulleys as well as knowledge of angular eye orientation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The oculomotor periphery was classically regarded as a simple mechanism executing complex behaviors specified explicitly by neural commands. A competing view has emerged that many important aspects of ocular motility are properties of the extraocular muscles and their associated connective tissue pulleys. This review considers current concepts regarding aspects of ocular motility that are mechanically determined versus those that are specified explicitly as innervation.

RECENT FINDINGS: While it was established several years ago that the rectus extraocular muscles have connective tissue pulleys, recent functional imaging and histology has suggested that the rectus pulley array constitutes an inner mechanism, analogous to a gimbal, that is rotated torsionally around the orbital axis by an outer mechanism driven by the oblique extraocular muscles. This arrangement may account mechanically for several commutative aspects of ocular motor control, including Listing's Law, yet permits implementation of non-commutative motility. Recent human behavioral studies, as well as neurophysiology in monkeys, are consistent with implementation of Listing's Law in the oculomotor periphery, rather than centrally.

SUMMARY: Varied evidence now strongly supports the conclusion that Listing's Law and other important ocular kinematics are mechanically determined. This finding implies more limited possibilities for neural adaptation to some ocular motor pathologies, but indicates possibilities for surgical treatments.},

abstract = {The rectus extraocular muscle (EOM) pulleys constrain EOM paths. During visual fixation with head immobile, actively controlled pulleys are known to maintain positions causing EOM pulling directions to change by one-half the change in eye position. This pulley behavior is consistent with Listing's law (LL) of ocular torsion as observed during fixation, saccades, and pursuit. However, pulley behavior during the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) has been unstudied. This experiment studied ocular counter-rolling (OCR), a static torsional VOR that violates LL but can be evoked during MRI. Tri-planar MRI was performed in 10 adult humans during central target fixation while positioned in right and left side down positions known to evoke static OCR. EOM cross-sections and paths were determined from area centroids. Paths were used to locate pulleys in three dimensions. Significant (P < 0.025) counter-rotational repositioning of the rectus pulley arrays of both orbits was observed in the coronal plane averaging 4.1 degrees (maximum, 8.7 degrees ) from right to left side down positions for the inferior, medial, and superior rectus pulleys. There was a trend for the lateral rectus averaging 1.4 degrees . Torsional shift of the rectus pulley array was associated with significant contractile cross-section changes in the superior and inferior oblique muscles. Torsional rectus pulley shift during OCR, which changes pulling directions of the rectus EOMs, correlates with known insertions of the oblique EOM orbital layers on rectus pulleys. The amount of pulley reconfiguration is roughly one-half of published values of ocular torsion during static OCR, an arrangement that would cause rectus pulling directions to change by less than one-half the amount of ocular torsion.},

abstract = {Extraocular muscle (EOM) paths during asymmetrical convergence were evaluated by tri-planar, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits of eight young adults during binocular fixation of a target aligned to one eye at 800 and 15 cm distance. Cross sections and paths of EOMs were determined from area centroids. In convergence, the aligned eye rotated and translated negligibly, while its inferior oblique (IO) muscle exhibited significant contractile thickening. There were no significant contractile changes in the cross sections of aligned eye rectus or superior oblique (SO) muscles in convergence. The converging eye rotated nasally 22.4 degrees but translated negligibly. The converging eye medial (MR) and lateral rectus (LR) muscles exhibited large contractile cross-section changes, and the IO showed significant contractile thickening, while the vertical rectus muscles and the SO did not. Anterior paths of three aligned eye rectus EOMs could be determined in convergence and shifted consistent with a 1.9 degrees extorsion of the rectus pulley array. Such extorsional reconfiguration of the rectus pulleys would move the pulleys in coordination with globe extorsion and avoid imparting torsional action to these EOMs. Extorsional rectus pulley shift in convergence is inconsistent with the reconfiguration predicted to explain the temporal tilting of Listing's planes, instead suggesting that this temporal tilting is due to variations in oblique EOM innervation. Absence of globe translation in convergence argues against overall EOM co-contraction. The reconfiguration of EOM geometry in convergence has important implications for single-unit studies of neural control.},

abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that extraocular muscle (EOM) pulleys, composed of collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle, are among the tissues surrounding the eye. High-resolution magnetic-resonance imaging appears to indicate that the pulleys serve to both constrain and alter the pulling paths of the EOMs. The active pulley hypothesis suggests that the orbital layer of the EOMs inserts on the pulley and serves to control it. Based on anatomical data, the active pulley hypothesis also suggests that the orbital layer does not rotate the eye within the orbit; this is done by the global layer of the muscle. However, no physiological data exist to confirm this hypothesis. Here we used stimulation-evoked eye movements in anesthetized monkeys and cats before and after destruction of the lateral rectus muscle pulley by removal of the lateral bony orbit and adjacent orbital tissue. The absence of these structures resulted in increased lateral, in the primate, and medial, in the cat, eye-movement amplitude and velocity. Vertical eye movements in the cat were not significantly affected. The results indicate that these increases, confined to horizontal eye-movement amplitude and velocity, may be attributed to passive properties within the orbit. In relation to the active pulley hypothesis, we could discern no clear impact (in terms of amplitude or velocity profile of the movements) of lateral eye exposure that could be directly attributable to the active lateral pulley system.},

The control of voluntary saccades to visual and remembered targets is modeled in terms of interactions between posterior parietal cortex, frontal eye fields, the basal ganglia (caudate and substantia nigra), superior colliculus, mediodorsal thalamus, and the saccade generator of the brainstem. Interactions include the modulation of eye movement motor error maps by topographic inhibitory projections, dynamic remapping of spatial target representations in saccade motor error maps, and sustained neural activity that embodies spatial memory. Models of these mechanisms implemented in our Neural Simulation Language simulate behavior and neural activity described in the literature, and suggest new experiments.},

@article{Donaldson2000,
abstract = {This article sets out to present a fairly comprehensive review of our knowledge about the functions of the receptors that have been found in the extraocular muscles--the six muscles that move each eye of vertebrates in its orbit--of all the animals in which they have been sought, including Man. Since their discovery at the beginning of the 20th century these receptors have, at various times, been credited with important roles in the control of eye movement and the construction of extrapersonal space and have also been denied any function whatsoever. Experiments intended to study the actions of eye muscle receptors and, even more so, opinions (and indeed polemic) derived from these observations have been influenced by the changing fashions and beliefs about the more general question of how limb position and movement is detected by the brain and which signals contribute to those aspects of this that are perceived (kinaesthesis). But the conclusions drawn from studies on the eye have also influenced beliefs about the mechanisms of kinaesthesis and, arguably, this influence has been even larger than that in the converse direction. Experimental evidence accumulated over rather more than a century is set out and discussed. It supports the view that, at the beginning of the 21st century, there are excellent grounds for believing that the receptors in the extraocular muscles are indeed proprioceptors, that is to say that the signals that they send into the brain are used to provide information about the position and movement of the eye in the orbit. It seems that this information is important in the control of eye movements of at least some types, and in the determination by the brain of the direction of gaze and the relationship of the organism to its environment. In addition, signals from these receptors in the eye muscles are seen to be necessary for the development of normal mechanisms of visual analysis in the mammalian visual cortex and for both the development and maintenance of normal visuomotor behaviour. Man is among those vertebrates to whose brains eye muscle proprioceptive signals provide information apparently used in normal sensorimotor functions; these include various aspects of perception, and of the control of eye movement. It is possible that abnormalities of the eye muscle proprioceptors and their signals may play a part in the genesis of some types of human squint (strabismus); conversely studies of patients with squint in the course of their surgical or pharmacological treatment have yielded much interesting evidence about the central actions of the proprioceptive signals from the extraocular muscles. The results of experiments on the eye have played a large part in the historical controversy, now in at least its third century, about the origin of signals that inform the brain about movement of parts of the body. Some of these results, and more of the interpretations of them, now need to be critically re-examined. The re-examination in the light of recent experiments that is presented here does not support many of the conclusions confidently drawn in the past and leads to both new insights and fresh questions about the roles of information from motor signals flowing out of the brain and that from signals from the peripheral receptors flowing into it. There remain many lacunae in our knowledge and filling some of these will, it is contended, be essential to advance our understanding further. It is argued that such understanding of eye muscle proprioception is a necessary part of the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of eye movement control and that it is also essential to an account of how organisms, including Man, build and maintain knowledge of their relationship to the external visual world. The eye would seem to provide a uniquely favourable system in which to study the way in which information derived within the brain about motor actions may interact with signals flowing in from peripheral receptors. The review is constructed in relatively independent sections that deal with particular topics. It ends with a fairly brief piece in which the author sets out some personal views about what has been achieved recently and what most immediately needs to be done. It also suggests some lines of study that appear to the author to be important for the future.},

abstract = {In a series of experiments, we examined the change in saccade trajectories observed when distractors are presented at non-target locations. The primary aim of the experiments was to examine multisensory interaction effects between the visual, auditory and somatosensory modalities in saccade generation. In each experiment observers made saccades to visual targets above and below fixation in the presence of visual, auditory or tactile stimuli to the left or right of fixation. In experiment 1 distractor location indicated which of two stimuli was the target for the saccade. Saccade trajectories showed strong leftward curvature following right-side distractors and showed rightward curvature following left-side distractors. The largest effects on trajectories were observed for visual distractors, but significant curvature was observed with auditory and somatosensory distractors. In experiment 2 saccades were made following the onset of a visual target (reflexive) or following presentation of an arrow at fixation (voluntary), and task-irrelevant crossmodal distractors were presented simultaneously with target onset. Both voluntary and reflexive saccades were found to curve away from task-irrelevant visual distractors, but auditory and somatosensory distractors did not modulate saccade trajectories. In experiment 3 task-irrelevant distractors preceded the onset of the target by 100 ms. Reflexive saccades were found to curve away from visual, auditory and somatosensory distractors, but voluntary saccades curved away from visual distractors only. The modulation of saccade trajectories by distractors from different modalities is interpreted in terms of inhibitory processes operating in neural structures involved in saccade generation. Our findings suggest that visual, auditory and somatosensory distractors can all modulate saccade trajectories. Such effects could be related to the inhibition of populations of neurons, in a common motor map, for the selection of a saccade target.},

abstract = {Coordinated orienting movements can be accurately performed without direct sensory control. Ocular saccades, for instance, have been shown to be reprogrammed after target disappearance when an intervening eye movement is electrically triggered before the saccade onset. Saccadic eye movements can also be executed toward memorized targets, even when the subject has been passively moved in darkness. Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for this goal-invariance property: either (i) the goal is reconstructed and memorized in the stable frame of reference linked to the environment ("allocentric, coordinates") or (ii) the goal is selected and memorized in the sensors-related maps ("egocentric coordinates") and is continuously updated by efferent copies of the motor commands. In this paper, we shall describe a formal neural network based on this second hypothesis. The results of the simulation show that target position can be memorized and accurately updated in a topologically ordered map, using a velocity-signal feedback. Moreover, this network has been submitted to a simple learning procedure by using the intermittent visual recurring afferent signal as the teaching signal. A similar mechanism could be involved in control of limb movement.},

abstract = {A control circuit is proposed to model the command of saccadic eye movements. Its wiring is deduced from a mathematical constraint, i.e. the necessity, for motor orders processing, to compute an approximate inverse function of the bio-mechanical function of the moving plant, here the bio-mechanics of the eye. This wiring is comparable to the anatomy of the cerebellar pathways. A predicting element, necessary for inversion and thus for movement accuracy, is modeled by an artificial neural network whose structure, deduced from physical constraints expressing the mechanics of the eye, is similar to the cell connectivity of the cerebellar cortex. Its functioning is set by supervised reinforcement learning, according to learning rules aimed at reducing the errors of pointing, and deduced from a differential calculation. After each movement, a teaching signal encoding the pointing error is distributed to various learning sites, as is, in the cerebellum, the signal issued from the inferior olive and conveyed to various cell types by the climbing fibers. Results of simulations lead to predict the existence of a learning site in the glomeruli. After learning, the model is able to accurately simulate saccadic eye movements. It accounts for the function of the cerebellar pathways and for the final integrator of the oculomotor system. The novelty of this model of movement control is that its structure is entirely deduced from mathematical and physical constraints, and is consistent with general anatomy, cell connectivity and functioning of the cerebellar pathways. Even the learning rules can be deduced from calculation, and they reproduce long term depression, the learning process which takes place in the dendritic arborization of the Purkinje cells. This approach, based on the laws of mathematics and physics, appears thus as an efficient way of understanding signal processing in the motor system.},

This information can also be used in real-time to control applications using the eyes. Recent innovations in the video game industry include alternative input modalities to provide an enhanced, more immersive user experience. In particular, eye gaze control has recently been explored as an input modality in video games. This book is an introduction for those interested in using eye tracking to control or analyze video games and virtual environments. Key concepts are illustrated through three case studies in which gaze control and voice recognition have been used in combination to control virtual characters and applications. The lessons learned in the case studies are presented and issues relating to incorporating eye tracking in interactive applications are discussed. The reader will be given an introduction to human visual attention, eye movements and eye tracking technologies. Previous work in the field of studying fixation behavior in games and using eye tracking for video game interaction will also be presented. The final chapter discusses ideas for how this field can be developed further to create richer interaction for characters and crowds in virtual environments. Alternative means of interaction in video games are especially important for disabled users for whom traditional techniques, such as mouse and keyboard, may be far from ideal. This book is also relevant for those wishing to use gaze control in applications other than games.},

abstract = {There are five different types of eye movements: saccades, smooth pursuit, vestibular ocular eye movements, optokinetic eye movements, and vergence eye movements. The purpose of this book is focused primarily on mathematical models of the horizontal saccadic eye movement system and the smooth pursuit system, rather than on how visual information is processed. A saccade is a fast eye movement used to acquire a target by placing the image of the target on the fovea. Smooth pursuit is a slow eye movement used to track a target as it moves by keeping the target on the fovea. The vestibular ocular movement is used to keep the eyes on a target during brief head movements. The optokinetic eye movement is a combination of saccadic and slow eye movements that keeps a full-field image stable on the retina during sustained head rotation. Each of these movements is a conjugate eye movement, that is, movements of both eyes together driven by a common neural source. A vergence movement is a non-conjugate eye movement allowing the eyes to track targets as they come closer or farther away. In this book, a 2009 version of a state-of-the-art model is presented for horizontal saccades that is 3rd-order and linear, and controlled by a physiologically based time-optimal neural network. The oculomotor plant and saccade generator are the basic elements of the saccadic system. The control of saccades is initiated by the superior colliculus and terminated by the cerebellar fastigial nucleus, and involves a complex neural circuit in the mid brain. This book is the second part of a book series on models of horizontal eye movements.},

abstract = {Fixation neurons (SCFNs) in the rostral pole of the superior colliculus (SC) and omnipause neurons (OPNs) in the nucleus raphe interpositus (rip) in the pons share similar discharge properties. Both types of neurons discharge tonically during periods of visual fixation and pause for saccadic eye movements, and their activation by electrical stimulation suppresses saccade generation. On the basis of these similarities and the projection from the rostral SC to the rip, it was hypothesized that SCFNs provide a major excitatory input to OPNs. We investigated the role and relationship of SCFNs and OPNs with respect to both fixation behavior and saccade generation by comparing their activity recorded in the same monkeys performing a gap saccade task. In this task, the central fixation point was extinguished 200 ms before the presentation of an eccentric saccadic target, and the discharges of OPNs and SCFNs were contrasted during visual fixation, nonvisual (gap) fixation, and saccade generation. During visual fixation, the mean discharge rate of OPNs was higher and more regular than that of SCFNs. During the gap period, SCFNs decreased their discharge rate before target appearance, whereas no change in discharge rate was observed in OPNs. For both SCFNs and OPNs, the activity level before target appearance was not correlated to saccadic reaction time. In contrast to SCFNs, several OPNs responded with a transient phasic increase in discharge immediately after the target presentation. Before their saccade-related pause, there was a gradual reduction in the activity of SCFNs, whereas OPNs had an abrupt cessation of discharge. SCFNs paused earlier than OPNs, but the OPN pause onset was better synchronized to saccade onset than the SCFN pause onset. OPNs resumed firing after their pause in activity earlier than SCFNs, and the OPN pause end was better synchronized to saccade end than the SCFN pause end. These physiological data reveal differences in the discharge properties of SCFNs and OPNs that are irreconcilable with the hypothesis that the discharge pattern of OPNs reflects simply the excitatory input from SCFNs. It is most likely that additional inputs to OPNs compensate for the reduction in discharge of SCFNs during these periods.},

abstract = {Advances in understanding the neural control of saccades (visual orienting movements made when the head is prevented from moving) stem largely from early modeling efforts which provided a framework for developing and testing hypotheses about the relationships between neural activity and observed behaviors. When the head is free to move, visual orienting is often accomplished with coordinated movements of the eyes and head. A recent description of the temporal progression (i.e., kinematics) of these movements led to the hypothesis that eye and head control signals interact. This hypothesis is now formalized as a control systems model which accounts for existing data and makes explicit predictions about the neural control of orienting gaze shifts.},

abstract = {Visual and vestibular senses are essential for appropriate motor behavior in three-dimensional (3D) space. Discovery of relevant specific subdivisions in sensory and motor pathways in recent decades has considerably advanced our understanding of the overall neural control of movement. Such subdivisions must eventually be further delineated into functional neural circuits for purposeful motor acts. Two critical questions are where in the brain do such circuits operate, and by what means. In this chapter, these issues are addressed for smooth tracking eye-movement systems in the simian. These results show that contrary to current understanding, synthesis of the functionally similar eye-movement systems, smooth-pursuit and vergence, takes place in the frontal cortex. This processing, which is of higher order than previously supposed, enables primates to track and manipulate objects moving in 3D space with the utmost of efficiency.},

abstract = {Through the development of a high-acuity fovea, primates with frontal eyes have acquired the ability to use binocular eye movements to track small objects moving in space. The smooth-pursuit system moves both eyes in the same direction to track movement in the frontal plane (frontal pursuit), whereas the vergence system moves left and right eyes in opposite directions to track targets moving towards or away from the observer (vergence tracking). In the cerebral cortex and brainstem, signals related to vergence eye movements--and the retinal disparity and blur signals that elicit them--are coded independently of signals related to frontal pursuit. Here we show that these types of signal are represented in a completely different way in the smooth-pursuit region of the frontal eye fields. Neurons of the frontal eye field modulate strongly during both frontal pursuit and vergence tracking, which results in three-dimensional cartesian representations of eye movements. We propose that the brain creates this distinctly different intermediate representation to allow these neurons to function as part of a system that enables primates to track and manipulate objects moving in three-dimensional space.},

abstract = {Pursuit eye movements are smooth rotations of the eye aimed at tracking moving objects. During pursuit, the visual system " compensates" for the eye movements, and transforms image movements captured by the eye from retinal to extra-retinal coordinates, for world-centered perception and action. When this function is impaired such as in schizophrenia, subjects misattribute retinal movements generated by their own eye movements to external sources. Surprisingly, even in healthy subjects pursuit compensation is incomplete, and results in illusory perception of motion. Neurophysiological, psychophysical and imaging studies elucidated many aspects of the neural substrates of visual processing during pursuit, including where and how in the cortex visual and non-visual signals interact to produce extra-retinal perception of motion. Here we review current understanding of motion processing in the visual cortex during pursuit and its relation to perception, from a broad perspective drawing from electrophysiology, fMRI, psychophysics and computational modeling. We discuss the experimental findings in the context of theories of pursuit compensation, and review some of the open questions in the field. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the present study we used single-unit recording techniques in alert rhesus monkeys to investigate a precerebellar nucleus, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP), for neurons related to vergence and ocular accommodation. 2. In the medial NRTP, we identified 32 cells with activity that linearly increased with increases in the amplitude of the near response and 33 cells with activity that linearly increased with increases in the amplitude of the far response. These near and far response neurons were often encountered close to neurons displaying saccade-related activity, but their activity was related neither to saccadic nor to smooth pursuit eye movements. Micro-stimulation at the site of near or far response neurons often produced changes in vergence angle and accommodation. 3. The NRTP is known to receive cortical afferents and to have reciprocal connections with the cerebellum; therefore it is likely that the near and far response neurons in the medial NRTP form part of a cerebropontocerebellar pathway modulating or controlling vergence and ocular accommodation.},

Despite the importance of these coordinated eye movements (the 'near response') very little is known about the role of the cerebral cortex in their control. As near-response neurons exist within the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, which receives input from the frontal eye field region of frontal cortex, and this cortical region is known to be involved in saccadic and smooth-pursuit eye movements, we propose that a nearby region might play a role in vergence and ocular accommodation. Here we provide evidence from rhesus monkeys that a region of frontal cortex located immediately anterior to the saccade-related frontal eye field region is involved in vergence and ocular accommodation, and in the sensorimotor transformations required for these eye movements. We conclude that the macaque frontal cortex is involved in the control of all voluntary eye movements, and suggest that the definition of the frontal eye fields should be expanded to include this region.},

abstract = {A neural model is developed of the neural circuitry in the reticular formation that is used to generate saccadic eye movements. The model simulates the behavior of identified cell types - such as long-lead burst neurons, short-lead excitatory and inhibitory burst neurons, omnipause neurons, and tonic neurons under many experimental conditions. Simulated phenomena include: saccade staircases, duration and amplitude of cell discharges for saccades of variable amplitude, component stretching to achieve straight oblique saccades, saturation of saccade velocity after saturation of saccade amplitude in response to high stimulation frequencies, tradeoffs between saccade velocity and duration to generate constant saccade amplitude, conservation of saccade amplitude in response to sufficiently brief stimulation of omnipause neurons, and high velocity smooth eye movements evoked by high levels of electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus. Previous saccade generator models have not explained this range of data. These models have also invoked mechanisms for which no neurophysiological evidence has been forthcoming, such as resetable integrators, perfect integrators, or target position movement commands. The present model utilizes only known reticular formation neurons. It suggests that a key part of the feedback loop within the saccade generator is realized by inhibitory feedback from short-lead to long-lead burst neurons, in response to excitatory feedforward signals from long-lead to short-lead burst neurons. When this property is combined with opponent interactions between agonist and antagonist muscle-controlling neurons, and motor error, or vector, inputs from the superior colliculus and other saccade-controlling brain regions, all of the above data can be explained. Taken together, these components generate a saccade reset cycle whereby activation of long-lead burst neurons inhibits omnipause neurons and thereby disinhibits short-lead excitatory burst neurons. The excitatory short-lead burst neurons can then respond to excitatory inputs from the long-lead burst neurons. Outputs from the excitatory short-lead burst neurons are integrated by the tonic cells while they also inhibit the long-lead burst neurons via inhibitory burst interneurons. When this inhibition is complete, the omnipause neurons are disinhibited. The omnipause neurons can then, once again, inhibit the short- lead burst neurons, whose inhibition of the long-lead burst neurons is thereby removed. The saccadic cycle can then begin again. In response to sustained electrical input, this cycle generates a staircase of identical saccades whose properties match the data much better than the staircases proposed by alternative models. A comparative analysis of the hypotheses and predictive capabilities of other saccade generator models is provided.},

abstract = {Rapid eyelid closure, or a blink, often accompanies head-restrained and head-unrestrained gaze shifts. This study examines the interactions between such gaze-evoked blinks and gaze shifts in monkeys. Blink probability increases with gaze amplitude and at a faster rate for head-unrestrained movements. Across animals, blink likelihood is inversely correlated with the average gaze velocity of large-amplitude control movements. Gaze-evoked blinks induce robust perturbations in eye velocity. Peak and average velocities are reduced, duration is increased, but accuracy is preserved. The temporal features of the perturbation depend on factors such as the time of blink relative to gaze onset, inherent velocity kinematics of control movements, and perhaps initial eye-in-head position. Although variable across animals, the initial effect is a reduction in eye velocity, followed by a reacceleration that yields two or more peaks in its waveform. Interestingly, head velocity is not attenuated; instead, it peaks slightly later and with a larger magnitude. Gaze latency is slightly reduced on trials with gaze-evoked blinks, although the effect was more variable during head-unrestrained movements; no reduction in head latency is observed. Preliminary data also demonstrate a similar perturbation of gaze-evoked blinks during vertical saccades. The results are compared with previously reported effects of reflexive blinks (evoked by air-puff delivered to one eye or supraorbital nerve stimulation) and discussed in terms of effects of blinks on saccadic suppression, neural correlates of the altered eye velocity signals, and implications on the hypothesis that the attenuation in eye velocity is produced by a head movement command.},

abstract = {As we look around, the orientation of our eyes depends on the order of the rotations that are carried out, a mathematical feature of rotatory motions known as noncommutativity. Theorists and experimentalists continue to debate how biological systems deal with this property when generating kinematically appropriate movements. Some believe that this is always done by neural commands to a simplified eye plant. Others have postulated that noncommutativity is implemented solely by the mechanical properties of the eyeball. Here we directly examined what the brain tells the muscles, by recording motoneuron activities as monkeys made eye movements. We found that vertical recti and superior/inferior oblique motoneurons, which drive sensory-generated torsional eye movements, do not modulate their firing rates according to the noncommutative-driven torsion during pursuit. We conclude that part of the solution for kinematically appropriate eye movements is found in the mechanical properties of the eyeball, although neural computations remain necessary and become increasingly important during head movements.

The wealth of data gathered allowed the conception of numerous computational models. These models proposed descriptions of the putative mechanisms generating this data, and, in turn, made predictions and helped to plan new experiments. In this article, we review the computational models of the five main brain regions involved in saccade generation: reticular formation saccadic burst generators, superior colliculus, cerebellum, basal ganglia and premotor cortical areas. We present the various topics these models are concerned with: location of the feedback loop, multimodal saccades, long-term adaptation, on the fly trajectory correction, strategy and metrics selection, short-term spatial memory, transformations between retinocentric and craniocentric reference frames, sequence learning, to name the principle ones. Our objective is to provide a global view of the whole system. Indeed, narrowing too much the modelled areas while trying to explain too much data is a recurrent problem that should be avoided. Moreover, beyond the multiple research topics remaining to be solved locally, questions regarding the operation of the whole structure can now be addressed by building on the existing models. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

As suggested by previous research, control of gaze holding is assumed to be enhanced by the floccular lobe, whereas control of the saccadic pulse is governed by the oculomotor vermis and fastigial nucleus. In the present work, a negative feedback loop via the paramedian tract neurons and the floccular lobe that contains a forward model of the oculomotor plant is supposed to enhance the time constant of the brainstem integrator. Control of saccadic amplitude is hypothesized to be achieved by a more complex network: feedforward projections from the superior colliculus via the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis to the oculomotor vermis and fastigial nucleus cooperate with feedback connections from excitatory burst neurons to overcome the sluggishness of the assumed local feedback loop formed via the superior colliculus and to implement inverse dynamics of downstream neural and motor processing.},

Beginning with models of the final ocular pathway consisting of eye plant and the neural velocity-to-position integrator for gaze holding, models of the motor part of the saccadic system, models of the vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs), and of the smooth pursuit system are reviewed. As an example, a simple model of the 3-D VOR is developed which shows why the eyes rotate around head-fixed axes during rapid VOR responses such as head impulses, but follow a compromise between head-fixed axes and Listing's law for slow VOR responses.},

abstract = {During visual fixation, the image of an object is maintained within the fovea. Previous studies have shown that such maintenance involves the deep superior colliculus (dSC). However, the mechanisms by which the dSC supports visual fixation remain controversial. According to one view, activity in the rostral dSC maintains gaze direction by preventing neurons in the caudal dSC from issuing saccade commands. An alternative hypothesis proposes that gaze direction is achieved through equilibrium of target position signals originating from the two dSCs. Here, we show in monkeys that artificially reducing activity in the rostral half of one dSC results in a biased estimate of target position during fixation, consistent with the second hypothesis, rather than an inability to maintain gaze fixation as predicted by the first hypothesis. After injection of muscimol at rostral sites in the dSC, fixation became more stable since microsaccade rate was reduced rather than increased. Moreover, the scatter of eye positions was offset relative to preinactivation baselines. The magnitude and the direction of the offsets depended on both the target size and the injected site in the collicular map. Other oculomotor parameters, such as the accuracy of saccades to peripheral targets and the amplitude and velocity of fixational saccades, were largely unaffected. These results suggest that the rostral half of the dSC supports visual fixation through a distributed representation of behaviorally relevant target position signals. The inactivation-induced fixation offset establishes the foveal visual stimulation that is required to restore the balance of activity between the two dSCs.},

abstract = {The simple-spike firing frequency of 30 Purkinje cells (P cells) in the ventral paraflocculus (VPFL) of alert monkeys was studied in relation to vertical slow eye movements, termed ocular following response (OFR), induced by large-field visual motions of different velocities and durations. To quantitatively analyze the relationship between eye movement and firing frequency, an inverse dynamics representation of the eye movement was used for reconstructing the temporal waveform of firing. Coefficients of eye-acceleration, velocity, and position, bias, and time lag between firing and eye movement were estimated by least-square error method. In the regression analyses for each stimulus condition, 86\% (146/170) of the well-modulated temporal firing patterns taken from those 30 P cells were reconstructed successfully from eye movement. The model with acceleration, velocity, and position terms, which we used, was shown as the best among several potential models by Cp statistics, consistent with t-test of significance of each term. Reliable coefficients were obtained from 75\% (109/146) of the well-reconstructed firing patterns of 28 cells among 30. The estimated coefficients were larger (statistically significant) for slow stimuli than for fast stimuli, suggesting changes in sensitivities under different conditions. However, firing patterns of each cell under several different conditions were frequently well reconstructed by an inverse dynamics representation with a single set of coefficients (13 cells among 21). This indicates that the relationships between P cell firing and OFR are roughly linear in those stimulus ranges. The estimated coefficients for acceleration and velocity suggested that the VPFL P cells properly encode the dynamic components of the motor command during vertical OFR. As for the positional component, however, these P cells are correlated with eye movement in the opposite direction. In the regression analysis without positional component, remarkable differences between observed and reconstructed firing patterns were noted especially in the initial phase of the movements, indicating that the negative positional component was not negligible during OFR. Thus we conclude that, during OFR, the VPFL P cells cannot provide the necessary final motor command, and other brain regions, downstream neural structures, or other types of P cells must provide lacking position-dependent motor commands. This finding about the negative correlation with the position is in the opposite sign with previous studies obtained from the fixation and the smooth pursuit movement. From these comparisons, how the VPFL contributes to a part of the final motor command or how other brain regions complement the VPFL is suggested to be different for early and late phases of the movements.},

abstract = {The deeper layers of the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) contain a topographic motor map in which a localized population of cells is recruited for each saccade, but how the brain stem decodes the dynamic SC output is unclear. Here we analyze saccade-related responses in the monkey SC to test a new dynamic ensemble-coding model, which proposes that each spike from each saccade-related SC neuron adds a fixed, site-specific contribution to the intended eye movement command. As predicted by this simple theory, we found that the cumulative number of spikes in the cell bursts is tightly related to the displacement of the eye along the ideal straight trajectory, both for normal saccades and for strongly curved, blink-perturbed saccades toward a single visual target. This dynamic relation depends systematically on the metrics of the saccade displacement vector, and can be fully predicted from a quantitative description of the cell's classical movement field. Furthermore, we show that a linear feedback model of the brain stem, which is driven by dynamic linear vector summation of measured SC firing patterns, produces realistic two-dimensional (2D) saccade trajectories and kinematics. We conclude that the SC may act as a nonlinear, vectorial saccade generator that programs an optimal straight eye-movement trajectory.},

@article{Goossens2012,
abstract = {A major challenge in computational neurobiology is to understand how populations of noisy, broadly-tuned neurons produce accurate goal-directed actions such as saccades. Saccades are high-velocity eye movements that have stereotyped, nonlinear kinematics; their duration increases with amplitude, while peak eye-velocity saturates for large saccades. Recent theories suggest that these characteristics reflect a deliberate strategy that optimizes a speed-accuracy tradeoff in the presence of signal-dependent noise in the neural control signals. Here we argue that the midbrain superior colliculus (SC), a key sensorimotor interface that contains a topographically-organized map of saccade vectors, is in an ideal position to implement such an optimization principle. Most models attribute the nonlinear saccade kinematics to saturation in the brainstem pulse generator downstream from the SC. However, there is little data to support this assumption. We now present new neurophysiological evidence for an alternative scheme, which proposes that these properties reside in the spatial-temporal dynamics of SC activity. As predicted by this scheme, we found a remarkably systematic organization in the burst properties of saccade-related neurons along the rostral-to-caudal (i.e., amplitude-coding) dimension of the SC motor map: peak firing-rates systematically decrease for cells encoding larger saccades, while burst durations and skewness increase, suggesting that this spatial gradient underlies the increase in duration and skewness of the eye velocity profiles with amplitude. We also show that all neurons in the recruited population synchronize their burst profiles, indicating that the burst-timing of each cell is determined by the planned saccade vector in which it participates, rather than by its anatomical location. Together with the observation that saccade-related SC cells indeed show signal-dependent noise, this precisely tuned organization of SC burst activity strongly supports the notion of an optimal motor-control principle embedded in the SC motor map as it fully accounts for the straight trajectories and kinematic nonlinearity of saccades.},

abstract = {Trigeminal reflex blinks evoked near the onset of a saccade cause profound spatial-temporal perturbations of the saccade that are typically compensated in mid-flight. This paper investigates the influence of reflex blinks on the discharge properties of saccade-related burst neurons (SRBNs) in intermediate and deep layers of the monkey superior colliculus (SC). Twenty-nine SRBNs, recorded in three monkeys, were tested in the blink-perturbation paradigm. We report that the air puff stimuli, used to elicit blinks, resulted in a short-latency ( approximately 10 ms) transient suppression of saccade-related SRBN activity. Shortly after this suppression (within 10-30 ms), all neurons resumed their activity, and their burst discharge then continued until the perturbed saccade ended near the extinguished target. This was found regardless whether the compensatory movement was into the cell's movement field or not. In the limited number of trials where no compensation occurred, the neurons typically stopped firing well before the end of the eye movement. Several aspects of the saccade-related activity could be further quantified for 25 SRBNs. It appeared that 1) the increase in duration of the high-frequency burst was well correlated with the (two- to threefold) increase in duration of the perturbed movement. 2) The number of spikes in the burst for control and perturbed saccades was quite similar. On average, the number of spikes increased only 14\%, whereas the mean firing rate in the burst decreased by 52\%. 3) An identical number of spikes were obtained between control and perturbed responses when burst and postsaccadic activity were both included in the spike count. 4) The decrease of the mean firing rate in the burst was well correlated with the decrease in the velocity of perturbed saccades. 5) Monotonic relations between instantaneous firing rate and dynamic motor error were obtained for control responses but not for perturbed responses. And 6) the high-frequency burst of SRBNs with short-lead and long-lead presaccadic activity (also referred to as burst and buildup neurons, respectively) showed very similar features. Our findings show that blinking interacts with the saccade premotor system already at the level of the SC. The data also indicate that a neural mechanism, rather than passive elastic restoring forces within the oculomotor plant, underlies the compensation for blink-related perturbations. We propose that these interactions occur downstream from the motor SC and that the latter may encode the desired displacement vector of the eyes by sending an approximately fixed number of spikes to the brainstem saccadic burst generator.},

abstract = {The coordination between eye and head movements during a rapid orienting gaze shift has been investigated mainly when subjects made horizontal movements towards visual targets with the eyes starting at the centre of the orbit. Under these conditions, it is difficult to identify the signals driving the two motor systems, because their initial motor errors are identical and equal to the coordinates of the sensory stimulus (i.e. retinal error). In this paper, we investigate head-free gaze saccades of human subjects towards visual as well as auditory stimuli presented in the two-dimensional frontal plane, under both aligned and unaligned initial fixation conditions. Although the basic patterns for eye and head movements were qualitatively comparable for both stimulus modalities, systematic differences were also obtained under aligned conditions, suggesting a task-dependent movement strategy. Auditory-evoked gaze shifts were endowed with smaller eye-head latency differences, consistently larger head movements and smaller concomitant ocular saccades than visually triggered movements. By testing gaze control for eccentric initial eye positions, we found that the head displacement vector was best related to the initial head motor-error (target-re-head), rather than to the initial gaze error (target-re-eye), regardless of target modality. These findings suggest an independent control of the eye and head motor systems by commands in different frames of reference. However, we also observed a systematic influence of the oculomotor response on the properties of the evoked head movements, indicating a subtle coupling between the two systems. The results are discussed in view of current eye-head coordination models.},

abstract = {The ability to navigate in the world and execute appropriate behavioral responses depends critically on the contribution of the vestibular system to the detection of motion and spatial orientation. A complicating factor is that otolith afferents equivalently encode inertial and gravitational accelerations. Recent studies have demonstrated that the brain can resolve this sensory ambiguity by combining signals from both the otoliths and semicircular canal sensors, although it remains unknown how the brain integrates these sensory contributions to perform the nonlinear vector computations required to accurately detect head movement in space. Here, we illustrate how a physiologically relevant, nonlinear integrative neural network could be used to perform the required computations for inertial motion detection along the interaural head axis. The proposed model not only can simulate recent behavioral observations, including a translational vestibuloocular reflex driven by the semicircular canals, but also accounts for several previously unexplained characteristics of central neural responses such as complex otolith-canal convergence patterns and the prevalence of dynamically processed otolith signals. A key model prediction, implied by the required computations for tilt-translation discrimination, is a coordinate transformation of canal signals from a head-fixed to a spatial reference frame. As a result, cell responses may reflect canal signal contributions that cannot be easily detected or distinguished from otolith signals. New experimental protocols are proposed to characterize these cells and identify their contributions to spatial motion estimation. The proposed theoretical framework makes an essential first link between the computations for inertial acceleration detection derived from the physical laws of motion and the neural response properties predicted in a physiologically realistic network implementation.},

abstract = {How does the saccadic movement system select a target when visual, auditory, and planned movement commands differ? How do retinal, head-centered, and motor error coordinates interact during the selection process? Recent data on superior colliculus (SC) reveal a spreading wave of activation across buildup cells the peak activity of which covaries with the current gaze error. In contrast, the locus of peak activity remains constant at burst cells, whereas their activity level decays with residual gaze error. A neural model answers these questions and simulates burst and buildup responses in visual, overlap, memory, and gap tasks. The model also simulates data on multimodal enhancement and suppression of activity in the deeper SC layers and suggests a functional role for NMDA receptors in this region. In particular, the model suggests how auditory and planned saccadic target positions become aligned and compete with visually reactive target positions to select a movement command. For this to occur, a transformation between auditory and planned head-centered representations and a retinotopic target representation is learned. Burst cells in the model generate teaching signals to the spreading wave layer. Spreading waves are produced by corollary discharges that render planned and visually reactive targets dimensionally consistent and enable them to compete for attention to generate a movement command in motor error coordinates. The attentional selection process also helps to stabilize the map-learning process. The model functionally interprets cells in the superior colliculus, frontal eye field, parietal cortex, mesencephalic reticular formation, paramedian pontine reticular formation, and substantia nigra pars reticulata.},

@article{Guitton1985,
abstract = {The frontal eye field (FEF) and superior colliculus (SC) are thought to form two parallel systems for generating saccadic eye movements. The SC is thought classically to mediate reflex-like orienting movements. Thus it can be hypothesized that the FEF exerts a higher level control on a visual grasp reflex. To test this hypothesis we have studied the saccades of patients who have had discrete unilateral removals of frontal lobe tissue for the relief of intractable epilepsy. The responses of these patients were compared to those of normal subjects and patients with unilateral temporal lobe removals. Two tasks were used. In the first task the subject was instructed to look in the direction of a visual cue that appeared unexpectedly 12 degrees to the left or right of a central fixation point (FP), in order to identify a patterned target that appeared 200 ms or more later. In the second "anti-saccade" task the subject was required to look not at the location of the cue but in the opposite direction, an equal distance from FP where after 200 ms or more the patterned target appeared. Three major observations have emerged from the present study. Most frontal patients, with lesions involving both the dorsolateral and mesial cortex had long term difficulties in suppressing disallowed glances to visual stimuli that suddenly appeared in peripheral vision. In such patients, saccades that were eventually directed away from the cue and towards the target were nearly always triggered by the appearance of the target itself irrespective of whether or not the "anti-saccade" was preceded by a disallowed glance. Those eye movements away from the cue were only rarely generated spontaneously across the blank screen during the cue-target time interval. The latency of these visually-triggered saccades was very short (80-140 ms) compared to that of the correct saccades (170-200 ms) to the cue when the cue and target were on the same side, thereby suggesting that the structures removed in these patients normally trigger saccades after considerable computations have already been performed. The results support the view that the frontal lobes, particularly the dorsolateral region which contains the FEF and possibly the supplementary motor area contribute to the generation of complex saccadic eye-movement behaviour. More specifically, they appear to aid in suppressing unwanted reflex-like oculomotor activity and in triggering the appropriate volitional movements when the goal for the movement is known but not yet visible.},

The function of microsaccades is controversial, largely because the neural mechanisms responsible for their generation are unknown. Here, we show that the superior colliculus (SC), a retinotopically organized structure involved in voluntary-saccade target selection, plays a causal role in microsaccade generation. Neurons in the foveal portion of the SC increase their activity before and during microsaccades with sizes of only a few minutes of arc and exhibit selectivity for the direction and amplitude of these movements. Reversible inactivation of these neurons significantly reduces microsaccade rate without otherwise compromising fixation. These results, coupled with computational modeling of SC activity, demonstrate that microsaccades are controlled by the SC and explain the link between microsaccades and visual attention.},

abstract = {The primate superior colliculus (SC) is often viewed as composed of two distinct motor zones with complementary functions: a peripheral region that helps generate saccades to eccentric targets and a central one that maintains fixation by suppressing saccades. Here, we directly tested the alternative interpretation that topography in the SC is not strictly motor, nor does it form two distinct zones, but instead forms a single map of behaviorally relevant goal locations. Primates tracked the invisible midpoint between two moving stimuli, such that the stimuli guiding tracking were peripheral whereas the inferred movement goal was foveal and parafoveal. Temporary inactivation of neurons in the central portion of the topographic map of the SC, representing the invisible goal, caused stable offsets in eye position during tracking that were directed away from the retinotopic position encoded by the inactivated SC site. Critically, these offsets were not accompanied by a systematic inability to generate or suppress saccades, and they were not fully explained by motor deficits in saccades, smooth pursuit, or fixation. In addition, the magnitude of the offset depended on the eccentricity of the inactivated site as well as the degree of spatial uncertainty associated with the behavioral goal. These results indicate that gaze control depends on the balance of activity across a map of goal locations in the SC, and that by silencing some of the neurons in the normally active population representing the behavioral goal, focal inactivation causes a biased estimate of where to look.},

abstract = {During fixation, the eyes are not still but often exhibit microsaccadic movements. The function of microsaccades is controversial, largely because the neural mechanisms responsible for their generation are unknown. Here, we show that the superior colliculus (SC), a retinotopically organized structure involved in voluntary-saccade target selection, plays a causal role in microsaccade generation. Neurons in the foveal portion of the SC increase their activity before and during microsaccades with sizes of only a few minutes of arc and exhibit selectivity for the direction and amplitude of these movements. Reversible inactivation of these neurons significantly reduces microsaccade rate without otherwise compromising fixation. These results, coupled with computational modeling of SC activity, demonstrate that microsaccades are controlled by the SC and explain the link between microsaccades and visual attention.},

abstract = {The primate superior colliculus (SC) has long been known to be involved in saccade generation. However, SC neurons also exhibit fixation-related and smooth-pursuit-related activity. A parsimonious explanation for these seemingly disparate findings is that the SC contains a map of behaviorally relevant goal locations, rather than just a motor map for saccades and fixation. This explanation predicts that SC activity should reflect the behavioral goal, even when the behavioral response is not fixation or saccades, and even if the goal does not correspond to a visual stimulus. We tested this prediction by using a tracking task that dissociates the stimulus and goal locations. In this task, monkeys tracked the invisible midpoint between two peripheral bars, such that the visual stimuli were peripheral but the goal was foveal/parafoveal. We recorded from SC neurons representing peripheral locations associated with the stimulus or central locations associated with the goal. Most neurons with peripheral response fields did not respond differently during tracking than during passive viewing of the stimulus under fixation; most neurons with central response fields responded more during tracking than during fixation, despite the lack of a visual stimulus. Moreover, the spatial distribution of activity during tracking was larger than that during fixation or tracking of a foveal stimulus, suggesting that the greater spatial uncertainty about the invisible goal corresponded to more widespread SC activity. These results demonstrate the flexibility with which activity across the SC represents the location, as well as the spatial precision, of behaviorally relevant goals for multiple eye movements.},

abstract = {Eye movements markedly change the pattern of retinal stimulation. To maintain stable vision, the brain possesses a variety of mechanisms that compensate for the retinal consequences of eye movements. However, eye movements may also be important for resolving the ambiguities often posed by visual inputs, because motor commands contain additional spatial information that is necessarily absent from retinal signals. To test this possibility, we used a perceptually ambiguous stimulus composed of four line segments, consistent with a shape whose vertices were occluded. In a passive condition, subjects fixated a spot while the shape translated along a certain trajectory. In several active conditions, the spot, occluder and shape translated such that when subjects tracked the spot, they experienced the same retinal stimulus as during fixation. We found that eye movements significantly promoted perceptual coherence compared to fixation. These results indicate that eye movement information constrains the perceptual interpretation of visual inputs.},

abstract = {Microsaccades are tiny saccades that occur during gaze fixation. Whereas these movements have traditionally been viewed as random, it was recently discovered that microsaccade directions can be significantly biased by covertly attended visual stimuli. The detailed mechanisms mediating such a bias are neither known nor immediately obvious, especially because the amplitudes of the movements influenced by attentional cueing could be up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the eccentricity of the attended location. Here, we tested whether activity in the peripheral superior colliculus (SC) is necessary for this correlation between attentional cueing and microsaccades. We reversibly and focally inactivated SC neurons representing peripheral regions of visual space while rhesus monkeys performed a demanding covert visual attention task. The normal bias of microsaccade directions observed in each monkey before SC inactivation was eliminated when a cue was placed in the visual region affected by the inactivation; microsaccades were, instead, biased away from the affected visual space. When the cue was placed at another location unaffected by SC inactivation, the baseline cue-induced bias of microsaccade directions remained mostly intact, because the cue was in unaffected visual space, and any remaining changes were again explained by a repulsion of microsaccades away from the inactivated region. Our results indicate that peripheral SC activity is required for the link between microsaccades and the cueing of covert visual attention, and that it could do so by altering the probability of triggering microsaccades without necessarily affecting the motor generation of these movements.},

abstract = {In primates, it is well known that there is a consistent relationship between the duration, peak velocity and amplitude of saccadic eye movements, known as the 'main sequence'. The reason why such a stereotyped relationship evolved is unknown. We propose that a fundamental constraint on the deployment of foveal vision lies in the motor system that is perturbed by signal-dependent noise (proportional noise) on the motor command. This noise imposes a compromise between the speed and accuracy of an eye movement. We propose that saccade trajectories have evolved to optimize a trade-off between the accuracy and duration of the movement. Taking a semi-analytical approach we use Pontryagin's minimum principle to show that there is an optimal trajectory for a given amplitude and duration; and that there is an optimal duration for a given amplitude. It follows that the peak velocity is also fixed for a given amplitude. These predictions are in good agreement with observed saccade trajectories and the main sequence. Moreover, this model predicts a small saccadic dead-zone in which it is better to stay eccentric of target than make a saccade onto target. We conclude that the main sequence has evolved as a strategy to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and speed.},

It is shown how SEE++, a biomechanical model of the oculomotor plant that was built on the ideas of Miller and Robinson (1984) can improve the understanding of the effects of changes to the oblique eye muscles. By displaying only selected muscles, and by illustrating the relative contribution of these muscles through color-coding the bulb surface, the functional properties of the oblique muscles can be presented in a much clearer way. Investigating the effects of a hyperactive inferior oblique muscle shows that this type of model can help to clarify the functional cause of a pathology, which can otherwise be unclear, even for common pathologies.},

abstract = {Saccadic eye movements are shifts in the direction of gaze that rapidly and accurately aim the fovea at targets of interest. Saccades are so brief that visual feedback cannot guide them to their targets. Therefore, the saccadic motor command must be accurately specified in advance of the movement and continually modified to compensate for growth, injury, and aging, which otherwise would produce dysmetric saccades. When a persistent dysmetria occurs in subjects with muscle weakness or neural damage or is induced in normal primates by the surreptitious jumping of a target forward or backward as a saccade is made to acquire the target, saccadic amplitude changes to reduce the dysmetria. Adaptation of saccadic amplitude or direction occurs gradually and is retained in the dark, thus representing true motor plasticity. Saccadic adaptation is more rapid in humans than in monkeys, usually is incomplete in both species, and is slower and less robust for amplitude increases than decreases. Adaptation appears to be motor rather than sensory. In humans, adaptation of saccades that would seem to require more sensory-motor processing does not transfer to saccades that seem to require less, suggesting the existence of distributed adaptation loci. In monkeys, however, transfer from more simple to more complex saccades is robust, suggesting a common adaptation site. Neurophysiological data from both species indicate that the oculomotor cerebellum is crucial for saccadic adaptation. This review shows that the precise, voluntary behaviors known as saccadic eye movements provide an alternative to simple reflexes for the study of the neuronal basis of motor learning.},

abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements are performed in order to prevent retinal image blur of a moving object. Rhesus monkeys are able to perform smooth pursuit eye movements quite similar as humans, even if the pursuit target does not consist in a simple moving dot. Therefore, the study of the neuronal responses as well as the consequences of micro-stimulation and lesions in trained monkeys performing smooth pursuit is a powerful approach to understand the human pursuit system. The processing of visual motion is achieved in the primary visual cortex and the middle temporal area. Further processing including the combination of retinal image motion signals with extra-retinal signals such as the ongoing eye and head movement occurs in subsequent cortical areas as the medial superior temporal area, the ventral intraparietal area and the frontal and supplementary eye field. The frontal eye field especially contributes anticipatory signals which have a substantial influence on the execution of smooth pursuit. All these cortical areas send information to the pontine nuclei, which in turn provide the input to the cerebellum. The cerebellum contains two pursuit representations: in the paraflocculus/flocculus region and in the posterior vermis. While the first representation is most likely involved in the coordination of pursuit and the vestibular-ocular reflex, the latter is involved in the precise adjustments of the eye movements such as adaptation of pursuit initiation. The output of the cerebellum is directed to the moto-neurons of the extra-ocular muscles in the brainstem. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We first recall results by previous authors, showing that the maximum shear stress on the retina grows with increasing viscosity of the fluid up to a saturation value. We then investigate how the wall shear stress changes if a thin layer of aqueous humour is present in the vitreous chamber, separating the retina from the vitreous replacement fluid. The theoretical predictions show that the existence of a thin layer of aqueous is sufficient to substantially decrease the shear stress on the retina. We finally discuss a theoretical model that predicts the stability conditions of the interface between the aqueous and a vitreous substitute. We discuss the implications of this model to understand the mechanisms leading to the formation of emulsion in the vitreous chamber, showing that instability of the interface is possible in a range of parameters relevant for the human eye.},

It has been hypothesized that an evolutionarily old part of the cerebellum, the flocculus, forms a modifiable accessory pathway for the vestibulo-ocular reflex arc for adaptive control, and that the modification is due to the synaptic plasticity induced by retinal errors conveyed by a unique structure of the cerebellum, the climbing fibers. The flocculus hypothesis has been supported by several lines of evidence, including lesioning or functionally impairing the flocculus and recording the activity of flocculus Purkinje cells, and, more recently, from pharmacologically or genetically inhibited synaptic plasticity, which produces long-term depression. There has also been debate on a possible site for memory retention in vestibulo-ocular-reflex adaptation, and about the signal content in flocculus Purkinje cells.

abstract = {Neural integration converts transient events into sustained neural activity. In the smooth pursuit eye movement system, neural integration is required to convert cerebellar output into the sustained discharge of extraocular motoneurons. We recorded the expression of integration in the time-varying firing rates of cerebellar and brainstem neurons in the monkey during pursuit of step-ramp target motion. Electrical stimulation with single shocks in the cerebellum identified brainstem neurons that are monosynaptic targets of inhibition from the cerebellar floccular complex. They discharge in relation to eye acceleration, eye velocity, and eye position, with a stronger acceleration signal than found in most other brainstem neurons. The acceleration and velocity signals can be accounted for by opponent contributions from the two sides of the cerebellum, without integration; the position signal implies participation in the integrator. Other neurons in the vestibular nucleus show a wide range of blends of signals related to eye velocity and eye position, reflecting different stages of integration. Neurons in the abducens nucleus discharge homogeneously in relation mainly to eye position, and reflect almost perfect integration of the cerebellar outputs. Average responses of neural populations and the diverse individual responses of large samples of individual neurons are reproduced by a hierarchical neural circuit based on a model suggested the anatomy and physiology of the larval zebrafish brainstem. The model uses a combination of feedforward and feedback connections to support a neural circuit basis for integration in monkeys and other species.},

abstract = {Vital to motor learning is information about movement error. Using this information, the brain creates neural learning signals that instruct a plasticity mechanism to produce appropriate behavioral learning. Little is known, however, about brain structures that generate learning signals for voluntary movements. Here we show that signals from the superior colliculus (SC) can drive learning in saccadic eye movements in the monkey. Electrical stimulation of the SC deeper layers, subthreshold for evoking saccades, was applied immediately (approximately 60 ms) after the end of horizontal saccades in one or both directions. The target disappeared during saccades and remained invisible for 1 s to eliminate effects of postsaccadic visual information. Repetitive pairing of saccades with SC stimulation produced a marked, two-dimensional shift in movement endpoint relative to the target location. The elicited endpoint shift took a gradual, approximately exponential course over several hundred saccades as in visually induced saccade adaptation. The shift in movement endpoint remained nearly unchanged after stimulation was discontinued, indicating involvement of neuronal plasticity. When both rightward and leftward saccades were paired with stimulation, their endpoints shifted in similar directions. The endpoint shift was directed contralaterally to the stimulated SC. The direction and size of the endpoint shift depended on the stimulation site in the SC. We propose that the SC, a brainstem structure long known to be crucial for saccade execution, is involved in motor learning and sends signals that dictate the direction of adaptive shift in saccade endpoint.},

abstract = {We examined the performance of a dynamic neural network that replicates much of the psychophysics and neurophysiology of eye-head gaze shifts without relying on gaze feedback control. For example, our model generates gaze shifts with ocular components that do not exceed 35 degrees in amplitude, whatever the size of the gaze shifts (up to 75 degrees in our simulations), without relying on a saturating nonlinearity to accomplish this. It reproduces the natural patterns of eye-head coordination in that head contributions increase and ocular contributions decrease together with the size of gaze shifts and this without compromising the accuracy of gaze realignment. It also accounts for the dependence of the relative contributions of the eyes and the head on the initial positions of the eyes, as well as for the position sensitivity of saccades evoked by electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus. Finally, it shows why units of the saccadic system could appear to carry gaze-related signals even if they do not operate within a gaze control loop and do not receive head-related information.},

These are coordinated movements of the eyes and head characterized by stereotypical metrics and kinematics. It is possible to determine the rules that the effectors must obey to execute them rapidly and accurately and the neural commands needed to implement these rules with the help of optimal control theory. In this study, we demonstrate that head-fixed saccades and head-free gaze shifts obey a simple physical principle, "the minimum effort rule." By direct comparison with existing models of the neural control of gaze shifts, we conclude that the neural circuitry that implements the minimum effort rule is one that uses inhibitory cross talk between independent eye and head controllers.},

abstract = {Remapping of gaze-centered target-position signals across saccades has been observed in the superior colliculus and several cortical areas. It is generally assumed that this remapping is driven by saccade-related signals. What is not known is how the different potential forms of this signal (i.e., visual, visuomotor, or motor) might influence this remapping. We trained a three-layer recurrent neural network to update target position (represented as a "hill" of activity in a gaze-centered topographic map) across saccades, using discrete time steps and backpropagation-through-time algorithm. Updating was driven by an efference copy of one of three saccade-related signals: a transient visual response to the saccade-target in two-dimensional (2-D) topographic coordinates (Vtop), a temporally extended motor burst in 2-D topographic coordinates (Mtop), or a 3-D eye velocity signal in brain stem coordinates (EV). The Vtop model produced presaccadic remapping in the output layer, with a "jumping hill" of activity and intrasaccadic suppression. The Mtop model also produced presaccadic remapping with a dispersed moving hill of activity that closely reproduced the quantitative results of Sommer and Wurtz. The EV model produced a coherent moving hill of activity but failed to produce presaccadic remapping. When eye velocity and a topographic (Vtop or Mtop) updater signal were used together, the remapping relied primarily on the topographic signal. An analysis of the hidden layer activity revealed that the transient remapping was highly dispersed across hidden-layer units in both Vtop and Mtop models but tightly clustered in the EV model. These results show that the nature of the updater signal influences both the mechanism and final dynamics of remapping. Taken together with the currently known physiology, our simulations suggest that different brain areas might rely on different signals and mechanisms for updating that should be further distinguishable through currently available single- and multiunit recording paradigms.},

@article{Keller1994,
abstract = {1. We recorded the spatial and temporal dynamics of saccade-related burst neurons (SRBNs) found in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SC) in the alert, behaving monkey. These burst cells are normally the first neurons recorded during radially directed microelectrode penetrations of the SC after the electrode has left the more dorsally situated visual layers. They have spatially delimited movement fields whose centers describe the well-studied motor map of the SC. They have a rather sharp, saccade-locked burst of activity that peaks just before saccade onset and then declines steeply during the saccade. Many of these cells, when recorded during saccade trials, also have an early, transient visual response and an irregular prelude of presaccadic activity. 2. Because saccadic eye movements normally have very stereotyped durations and velocity trajectories that vary systematically with saccade size, it has been difficult in the past to establish quantitatively whether the activity of SRBNs temporally codes dynamic saccadic control signals, e.g., dynamic motor error or eye velocity, where dynamic motor error is defined as a signal proportional to the instantaneous difference between desired final eye position and the actual eye position during a saccade. It has also not been unequivocally established whether SRBNs participate in an organized spatial shift of ensemble activity in the intermediate layers of the SC during saccadic eye movements. 3. To address these issues, we studied the activity of SRBNs using an interrupted saccade paradigm. Saccades were interrupted with pulsatile electrical stimulation through a microelectrode implanted in the omnipauser region of the brain stem while recordings were made simultaneously from single SRBNs in the SC. 4. Shortly after the beginning of the stimulation (which was electronically triggered at saccade onset), the eyes decelerated rapidly and stopped completely. When the high-frequency (typically 300-400 pulses per second) stimulation was terminated (average duration 12 ms), the eye movement was reinitiated and a resumed saccade was made accurately to the location of the target. 5. When we recorded from SRBNs in the more caudal colliculus, which were active for large saccades, cell discharge was powerfully and rapidly suppressed by the stimulation (average latency = 3.8 ms). Activity in the same cells started again just before the onset of the resumed saccade and continued during this saccade even though it has a much smaller amplitude than would normally be associated with significant discharge for caudal SC cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {A recent theoretical investigation has demonstrated that three-dimensional (3-D) eye position dependencies in the geometry of retinal stimulation must be accounted for neurally (i.e., in a visuomotor reference frame transformation) if saccades are to be both accurate and obey Listing's law from all initial eye positions. Our goal was to determine whether the human saccade generator correctly implements this eye-to-head reference frame transformation (RFT), or if it approximates this function with a visuomotor look-up table (LT). Six head-fixed subjects participated in three experiments in complete darkness. We recorded 60 degrees horizontal saccades between five parallel pairs of lights, over a vertical range of +/-40 degrees (experiment 1), and 30 degrees radial saccades from a central target, with the head upright or tilted 45 degrees clockwise/counterclockwise to induce torsional ocular counterroll, under both binocular and monocular viewing conditions (experiments 2 and 3). 3-D eye orientation and oculocentric target direction (i.e., retinal error) were computed from search coil signals in the right eye. Experiment 1: as predicted, retinal error was a nontrivial function of both target displacement in space and 3-D eye orientation (e.g., horizontally displaced targets could induce horizontal or oblique retinal errors, depending on eye position). These data were input to a 3-D visuomotor LT model, which implemented Listing's law, but predicted position-dependent errors in final gaze direction of up to 19.8 degrees. Actual saccades obeyed Listing's law but did not show the predicted pattern of inaccuracies in final gaze direction, i.e., the slope of actual error, as a function of predicted error, was only -0. 01 +/- 0.14 (compared with 0 for RFT model and 1.0 for LT model), suggesting near-perfect compensation for eye position. Experiments 2 and 3: actual directional errors from initial torsional eye positions were only a fraction of those predicted by the LT model (e. g., 32\% for clockwise and 33\% for counterclockwise counterroll during binocular viewing). Furthermore, any residual errors were immediately reduced when visual feedback was provided during saccades. Thus, other than sporadic miscalibrations for torsion, saccades were accurate from all 3-D eye positions. We conclude that 1) the hypothesis of a visuomotor look-up table for saccades fails to account even for saccades made directly toward visual targets, but rather, 2) the oculomotor system takes 3-D eye orientation into account in a visuomotor reference frame transformation. This transformation is probably implemented physiologically between retinotopically organized saccade centers (in cortex and superior colliculus) and the brain stem burst generator.},

Here we show that the SC codes neither desired gaze displacement nor gaze direction in space (as debated previously), but rather, desired gaze direction in retinal coordinates. Electrical micro-stimulation of the SC in two head-free (non-immobilized) monkeys evoked natural-looking, eye-head gaze shifts, with anterior sites producing small, fixed-vector movements and posterior sites producing larger, strongly converging movements. However, when correctly calculated in retinal coordinates, all of these trajectories became 'fixed-vector.' Moreover, our data show that this eye-centered SC command is then further transformed, as a function of eye and head position, by downstream mechanisms into the head- and body-centered commands for coordinated eye-head gaze shifts.},

abstract = {The neural mechanisms that specify target locations for gaze shifts and then convert these into desired patterns of coordinated eye and head movements are complex. Much of this complexity is only revealed when one takes a realistic three-dimensional (3-D) view of these processes, where fundamental computational problems such as kinematic redundancy, reference-frame transformations, and non-commutativity emerge. Here we review the underlying mechanisms and solutions for these problems, starting with a consideration of the kinematics of 3-D gaze shifts in human and non-human primates. We then consider the neural mechanisms, including cortical representation of gaze targets, the nature of the gaze motor command used by the superior colliculus, and how these gaze commands are decomposed into brainstem motor commands for the eyes and head. A general conclusion is that fairly simple coding mechanisms may be used to represent gaze at the cortical and collicular level, but this then necessitates complexity for the spatial updating of these representations and in the brainstem sensorimotor transformations that convert these signals into eye and head movements.},

For the oculomotor system, a redundancy in the degrees of freedom occurs during visually guided eye movements and is solved by implementing Listing's law and the half-angle rule, kinematic constraints that limit the range of eye positions and angular velocities used by the eyes. These constraints have been attributed either to neurally generated commands or to the physical mechanics of the eye and its surrounding muscles and tissues (i.e., the ocular plant). To directly test whether the ocular plant implements the half-angle rule, critical to the maintenance of Listing's law, we microstimulated the abducens nerve with the eye at different initial vertical eye positions. We report that the electrically evoked eye velocity exhibits the same eye position dependence as seen in visually guided smooth-pursuit eye movements. These results support an important role for the ocular plant in providing a solution to the degrees-of-freedom problem during eye movements.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence shows that the oculomotor plant is capable of implementing aspects of three-dimensional kinematics such as Listing's law and the half-angle rule. But these studies have only examined the eye under static conditions or with movements that normally obey these rules (e.g., saccades and pursuit). Here we test the capability of the oculomotor plant to rearrange itself as necessary for non-half-angle behavior. Three monkeys (Macaca mulatta) fixated five vertically displaced targets along the midsagittal plane while sitting on a motion platform that rotated sinusoidally about the naso-occipital axis. This activated the torsional, rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex, which exhibits a zero-angle or negative-angle rule (depending on the visual stimulus). On random sinusoidal cycles, we stimulated the abducens nerve and observed the resultant eye movements. If the plant has rearranged itself to implement this non-half-angle behavior, then stimulation should reveal this behavior. On the other hand, if the plant is only capable of half-angle behavior, then stimulation should reveal a half-angle rule. We find the latter to be true and therefore additional neural signals are likely necessary to implement non-half-angle behavior.},

abstract = {Two central, related questions in motor control are 1) how the brain represents movement directions of various effectors like the eyes and head and 2) how it constrains their redundant degrees of freedom. The interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC) integrates velocity commands from the gaze control system into position signals for three-dimensional eye and head posture. It has been shown that the right INC encodes clockwise (CW)-up and CW-down eye and head components, whereas the left INC encodes counterclockwise (CCW)-up and CCW-down components, similar to the sensitivity directions of the vertical semicircular canals. For the eyes, these canal-like coordinates align with Listing's plane (a behavioral strategy limiting torsion about the gaze axis). By analogy, we predicted that the INC also encodes head orientation in canal-like coordinates, but instead, aligned with the coordinate axes for the Fick strategy (which constrains head torsion). Unilateral stimulation (50 microA, 300 Hz, 200 ms) evoked CW head rotations from the right INC and CCW rotations from the left INC, with variable vertical components. The observed axes of head rotation were consistent with a canal-like coordinate system. Moreover, as predicted, these axes remained fixed in the head, rotating with initial head orientation like the horizontal and torsional axes of a Fick coordinate system. This suggests that the head is ordinarily constrained to zero torsion in Fick coordinates by equally activating CW/CCW populations of neurons in the right/left INC. These data support a simple mechanism for controlling head orientation through the alignment of brain stem neural coordinates with natural behavioral constraints.},

abstract = {How the brain transforms two-dimensional visual signals into multi-dimensional motor commands, and subsequently how it constrains the redundant degrees of freedom, are fundamental problems in sensorimotor control. During fixations between gaze shifts, the redundant torsional degree of freedom is determined by various neural constraints. For example, the eye- and head-in-space are constrained by Donders' law, whereas the eye-in-head obeys Listing's law. However, where and how the brain implements these laws is not yet known. In this study, we show that eye and head movements, elicited by unilateral microstimulations of the superior colliculus (SC) in head-free monkeys, obey the same Donders' strategies observed in normal behavior (i.e., Listing's law for final eye positions and the Fick strategy for the head). Moreover, these evoked movements showed a pattern of three-dimensional eye-head coordination, consistent with normal behavior, where the eye is driven purposely out of Listing's plane during the saccade portion of the gaze shift in opposition to a subsequent torsional vestibuloocular reflex slow phase, such that the final net torsion at the end of each head-free gaze shift is zero. The required amount of saccade-related torsion was highly variable, depending on the initial position of the eye and head prior to a gaze shift and the size of the gaze shift, pointing to a neural basis of torsional control. Because these variable, context-appropriate torsional saccades were correctly elicited by fixed SC commands during head-free stimulations, this shows that the SC only encodes the horizontal and vertical components of gaze, leaving the complexity of torsional organization to downstream control systems. Thus we conclude that Listing's and Donders' laws of the eyes and head, and their three-dimensional coordination mechanisms, must be implemented after the SC.},

abstract = {The ability to adapt a variety of motor acts to compensate for persistent natural or artificially induced errors in movement accuracy requires the cerebellum. For adaptation of the rapid shifts in the direction of gaze called saccades, the oculomotor vermis (OMV) of the cerebellum must be intact. We disrupted the neural circuitry of the OMV by manipulating gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the transmitter used by many neurons in the vermis. We injected either muscimol, an agonist of GABA, to inactivate the OMV or bicuculline, an antagonist, to block GABA inhibition. Our previous study showed that muscimol injections cause ipsiversive saccades to fall short of their targets, whereas bicuculline injections cause most ipsiversive saccades to overshoot. Once these dysmetrias had stabilized, we tested the monkey's ability to adapt saccade size to intra-saccadic target steps that produced a consistent saccade under-shoot (amplitude increase adaptation required) or overshoot (amplitude decrease adaptation required). Injections of muscimol abolished the amplitude increase adaptation of ipsiversive saccades, but had either no effect, or occasionally facilitated, amplitude decrease adaptation. In contrast, injections of bicuculline impaired amplitude decrease adaptation and usually facilitated amplitude increase adaptation. Neither drug produced consistent effects on the adaptation of contraversive saccades. Taken together, these data suggest that OMV activity is necessary for amplitude increase adaptation, whereas amplitude decrease adaptation may involve the inhibitory circuits within the OMV.},

abstract = {1. Among the multiple extrastriate visual areas in monkey cerebral cortex, several areas within the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are selectively related to visual motion processing. In this series of experiments we have attempted to relate this visual motion processing at a neuronal level to a behavior that is dependent on such processing, the generation of smooth-pursuit eye movements. 2. We studied two visual areas within the STS, the middle temporal area (MT) and the medial superior temporal area (MST). For the purposes of this study, MT and MST were defined functionally as those areas within the STS having a high proportion of directionally selective neurons. MST was distinguished from MT by using the established relationship of receptive-field size to eccentricity, with MST having larger receptive fields than MT. 3. A subset of these visually responsive cells within the STS were identified as pursuit cells--those cells that discharge during smooth pursuit of a small target in an otherwise dark room. Pursuit cells were found only in localized regions--in the foveal region of MT (MTf), in a dorsal-medial area of MST on the anterior bank of the STS (MSTd), and in a lateral-anterior area of MST on the floor and the posterior bank of the STS (MST1). 4. Pursuit cells showed two characteristics in common when their visual properties were studied while the monkey was fixating. Almost all cells showed direction selectivity for moving stimuli and included the fovea within their receptive fields. 5. The visual response of pursuit cells in the several areas differed in two ways. Cells in MTf preferred small moving spots of light, whereas cells in MSTd preferred large moving stimuli, such as a pattern of random dots. Cells in MTf had small receptive fields; those in MSTd usually had large receptive fields. Visual responses of pursuit neurons in MST1 were heterogeneous; some resembled those in MTf, whereas others were similar to those in MSTd. This suggests that the pursuit cells in MSTd and MST1 belong to different subregions of MST.},

The key difference between the proposed model and the models presented previously is a design that is geared towards linearity and capability of integration into a real-time human computer interaction system while providing force output for each extraocular muscle with values close to physiological measurements. The model is represented as a twelve order system created by a set of linear mechanical components representing major anatomical properties of extraocular muscles and the eye globe: muscle location, elasticity, viscosity, eye-globe rotational inertia, muscle active state tension, length tension and force velocity relationships. Linearity is a key point ensuring a real-time performance in an online implementation of the model with twelve order representation providing close match to the eye anatomical structure. Practical applications of the proposed model lie in the area of extraocular muscle effort estimation and human computer interaction.},

This issue is the sensor, transmission and other delays that exist in any eye tracker-based system, reducing its performance. A delay effect can be compensated by an accurate prediction of the eye movement trajectories. This paper introduces a mathematical model of the human eye that uses anatomical properties of the Human Visual System to predict eye movement trajectories. The eye mathematical model is transformed into a Kalman filter form to provide continuous eye position signal prediction during all eye movement types. The model presented in this paper uses brainstem control properties employed during transitions between fast (saccade) and slow (fixations, pursuit) eye movements. Results presented in this paper indicate that the proposed eye model in a Kalman filter form improves the accuracy of eye movement prediction and is capable of a real-time performance. In addition to the HCI systems with the direct eye gaze input, the proposed eye model can be immediately applied for a bit-rate/computational reduction in real-time gaze-contingent systems.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The orbital layer of each rectus extraocular muscle (EOM) inserts on connective tissue, and the global layer inserts on the eyeball. The active-pulley hypothesis (APH) proposes that a condensation of this connective tissue constitutes a pulley serving as the functional origin of the rectus EOM, and that this pulley makes coordinated, gaze-related translations along the EOM axis to implement a linear ocular motor plant. This study was designed to measure gaze-related shifts in EOM pulley locations.

METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in eight normal volunteers in 2-mm thickness coronal planes perpendicular to the orbital axis for nine cardinal gaze directions. Intravenous gadodiamide contrast was administered to define EOM tendons anterior to the globe equator. Paths of EOMs, defined by their area centroids, were transformed into an oculocentric coordinate system. Sharp inflections in EOM paths in secondary and tertiary gaze positions defined pulley locations which were then correlated with gaze direction and compared with theoretical predictions.

RESULTS: Rectus pulley positions were consistent with a central primary position. In tertiary gaze positions, each of the four rectus pulleys translated posteriorly with EOM contraction and anteriorly with EOM relaxation by a significant (P < 0.02) amount predicted by the APH, but more than 100 times greater than the translation predicted by a passive pulley model.

CONCLUSIONS: The APH prediction of coordinated anteroposterior shifting of EOM pulleys with gaze is quantitatively supported by changes in EOM path inflections among tertiary-gaze positions. Human rectus pulleys move to shift the ocular rotational axis to attain commutative behavior of the ocular motor plant.},

Emphasis is on three oculomotor behaviors: gaze control, smooth pursuit and saccades, and on their interactions with vision. Focus over the past 25 years has remained on the fundamental and classical questions: What are the mechanisms that keep gaze stable with either stationary or moving targets? How does the motion of the image on the retina affect vision? Where do we look - and why - when performing a complex task? How can the world appear clear and stable despite continual movements of the eyes? The past 25 years of investigation of these questions has seen progress and transformations at all levels due to new approaches (behavioral, neural and theoretical) aimed at studying how eye movements cope with real-world visual and cognitive demands. The work has led to a better understanding of how prediction, learning and attention work with sensory signals to contribute to the effective operation of eye movements in visually rich environments.},

We first estimated the population activity by computing weighted averages of Purkinje cell firing on a millisecond time scale. We then generated predicted eye movements by transforming this pooled neural activity with a description of eye mechanics. We found that the equally weighted average of Purkinje cell outputs produced a close match between the predicted and actual eye movements.

However, because rostral SC neurons respond to visual stimuli used to guide pursuit, it is also possible that the pursuit-related activity is simply a visual response. To test this possibility, we recorded the activity of neurons in the rostral SC as monkeys smoothly pursued a target that was briefly extinguished. We found that almost all rostral SC neurons in our sample maintained their pursuit-related activity during a brief visual blink, which was similar to the maintained activity they also exhibited during blinks imposed during fixation. These results indicate that discharge of rostral SC neurons during pursuit is not simply a visual response, but includes extraretinal signals.},

Oculomotor neurons in the superior colliculus of a primate responded to mismatches between eye and target positions, even when the animal made two different types of eye movements.

abstract = {1. In four human subjects, we measured the latency of saccadic eye movements made to a second, eccentric target after an initial, foveated target was extinguished. In separate interleaved trails, the targets were either both stationary ("fixation") or both moving with the same velocity ("pursuit"). For both fixation and pursuit trials, we extinguished the first target at randomized times during maintained fixation or pursuit and varied the time interval ("gap duration") before the appearance of the second target. 2. During both fixation and pursuit, the presence of a 200-ms gap reduced the latencies of saccades, compared with those obtained with no gap. For two subjects, we imposed additional, intermediate gap durations and found that saccade latencies varied as a function of gap duration. Furthermore, the latencies of saccades elicited during pursuit displayed the same dependence on gap duration as those elicited during fixation. 3. Our results demonstrate that the "gap effect" observed for saccades made during fixation also occurs for saccades made during pursuit. To the extent that the gap effect on saccade latency reflects a mechanism underlying the release of fixation, our results suggest that the same mechanism is invoked for saccades made during pursuit. From the viewpoint of initiating saccades, the existence of separate fixation and pursuit systems may be irrelevant.},

abstract = {Primates use a combination of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements to stabilize the retinal image of selected objects within the high-acuity region near the fovea. Pursuit has traditionally been viewed as a relatively automatic behavior, driven by visual motion signals and mediated by pathways that connect visual areas in the cerebral cortex to motor regions in the cerebellum. However, recent findings indicate that this view needs to be reconsidered. Rather than being controlled primarily by areas in extrastriate cortex specialized for processing visual motion, pursuit involves an extended network of cortical areas, and, of these, the pursuit-related region in the frontal eye fields appears to exert the most direct influence. The traditional pathways through the cerebellum are important, but there are also newly identified routes involving structures previously associated with the control of saccades, including the basal ganglia, the superior colliculus, and nuclei in the brain stem reticular formation. These recent findings suggest that the pursuit system has a functional architecture very similar to that of the saccadic system. This viewpoint provides a new perspective on the processing steps that occur as descending control signals interact with circuits in the brain stem and cerebellum responsible for gating and executing voluntary eye movements. Although the traditional view describes pursuit and saccades as two distinct neural systems, it may be more accurate to consider the two movements as different outcomes from a shared cascade of sensory-motor functions.},

Traditionally, these two eye movements have been viewed as distinct systems that are driven automatically by low-level visual inputs. However, two sets of findings argue for a new perspective on the control of voluntary eye movements. First, recent experiments have shown that pursuit and saccades are not controlled by entirely different neural pathways but are controlled by similar networks of cortical and subcortical regions and, in some cases, by the same neurons. Second, pursuit and saccades are not automatic responses to retinal inputs but are regulated by a process of target selection that involves a basic form of decision making. The selection process itself is guided by a variety of complex processes, including attention, perception, memory, and expectation. Together, these findings indicate that pursuit and saccades share a similar functional architecture. These points of similarity may hold the key for understanding how neural circuits negotiate the links between the many higher order functions that can influence behavior and the singular and coordinated motor actions that follow.},

The recent finding that the prelude activity of some SC neurons exhibits directional selectivity suggests that the rSC might process visual motion signals relevant for the control of pursuit. We have now tested the activity of buildup neurons in the rSC during the passive viewing of motion stimuli placed within their response field and also during the previewing of visual motion stimuli that were subsequently tracked with pursuit eye movements. We found that rSC buildup neurons typically responded well to motion stimuli, but that they exhibited essentially no selectivity for the direction or speed of visual motion, and that they also responded well to stationary flickering dots. However, during the previewing of visual motion prior to the onset of pursuit, many neurons did exhibit a buildup of activity similar to that exhibited before saccades. These results are inconsistent with the notion that the rSC mediates visual motion signals used to drive pursuit, but instead support the idea that visual motion signals can be used by rSC neurons as part of a mechanism for selecting targets for pursuit and saccades.},

abstract = {The intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC) compose a retinotopically organized motor map and are known to be important for the control of saccadic eye movements. However, recent studies have shown that the functions of the SC are not restricted to the motor control of saccades. The pattern of activity observed during multi-saccade movements, combined eye-head movements, and pursuit eye movements argue that activity in the SC indicates the location of the goal, but does not specify the particular movements that will be used to acquire the goal. Prior to the onset of a movement, the SC is involved in representing possible targets, as has been shown by the effects of manipulating target probability and the changes in pre-motor activity found during visual search tasks.

abstract = {Primates use a combination of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements to stabilize the retinal image of selected objects within the high-acuity region near the fovea. Pursuit has traditionally been viewed as a relatively automatic behavior, driven by visual motion signals and mediated by pathways that connect visual areas in the cerebral cortex to motor regions in the cerebellum. However, recent findings indicate that this view needs to be reconsidered. Rather than being controlled primarily by areas in extrastriate cortex specialized for processing visual motion, pursuit involves an extended network of cortical areas, and, of these, the pursuit-related region in the frontal eye fields appears to exert the most direct influence. The traditional pathways through the cerebellum are important, but there are also newly identified routes involving structures previously associated with the control of saccades, including the basal ganglia, the superior colliculus, and nuclei in the brain stem reticular formation. These recent findings suggest that the pursuit system has a functional architecture very similar to that of the saccadic system. This viewpoint provides a new perspective on the processing steps that occur as descending control signals interact with circuits in the brain stem and cerebellum responsible for gating and executing voluntary eye movements. Although the traditional view describes pursuit and saccades as two distinct neural systems, it may be more accurate to consider the two movements as different outcomes from a shared cascade of sensory-motor functions.},

However, recent studies have shown that the functions of the SC are not restricted to the motor control of saccades. The pattern of activity observed during multi-saccade movements, combined eye-head movements, and pursuit eye movements argue that activity in the SC indicates the location of the goal, but does not specify the particular movements that will be used to acquire the goal. Prior to the onset of a movement, the SC is involved in representing possible targets, as has been shown by the effects of manipulating target probability and the changes in pre-motor activity found during visual search tasks.

abstract = {The superior colliculus (SC) has long been known to be part of the network of brain areas involved in spatial attention, but recent findings have dramatically refined our understanding of its functional role. The SC both implements the motor consequences of attention and plays a crucial role in the process of target selection that precedes movement. Moreover, even in the absence of overt orienting movements, SC activity is related to shifts of covert attention and is necessary for the normal control of spatial attention during perceptual judgments. The neuronal circuits that link the SC to spatial attention may include attention-related areas of the cerebral cortex, but recent results show that the SC's contribution involves mechanisms that operate independently of the established signatures of attention in visual cortex. These findings raise new issues and suggest novel possibilities for understanding the brain mechanisms that enable spatial attention.},

After recording during a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm, we measured the difference in activity of the populations representing the two choices by computing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves on a millisecond timescale. A signal indicating the correct choice emerged from noise over time, forming a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. The observed performance corresponded to particular points along the predicted speed-accuracy curves - pursuit emphasizing speed and saccades emphasizing accuracy. These results show that activity from the same set of neurons in the superior colliculus can predict target choices for both pursuit and saccades.},

abstract = {Neurophysiological studies have shown that the deeper layers of the superior colliculus (SC) contain a topographical neural map representing the ocular vectorial displacement required for foveation of the target (motor error). It is known that the location of the active area in this neural map can be updated, not only following changes in retinal error, but also by efference-copy signals representing a change in eye position. Since it can be shown that a two-layer feedforward network cannot perform this task, we have simulated this system by training a three-layered neural network with access to retinal error and efference copy information about eye position. The network was taught to code motor error topographically (as in the collicular motor map) by generating population activity at the appropriate location in its output layer for different combinations of visual and efference copy signals. After the network had learned the required remapping transformation with sufficient precision (error of one deg over an 80 x 80 deg working range), the properties of the trained network were analyzed. From an investigation of the activity patterns of the hidden units in the trained network it appeared that information about target location relative to the head, implicitly present at the level of input signals, is no longer available at the level of the hidden layer. More detailed inspection of the properties of these units revealed that they code motor error. Their movement field is a monotonic function of motor error amplitude, and shows broad direction tuning specific for each unit. Finally, simulations were made with a four layered network with an architecture and access to input signals closely mimicking Robinson's model of the saccadic system. Again, the network was trained to represent motor error topographically in its output layer. The model shows, for the first time, how the computation of the topographical motor error map in the SC from retinal and eye position signals may proceed in two steps, involving a stage where target location is coded in a distributed fashion in craniotopic coordinates and a subsequent supracollicular stage, where radial motor error is represented in a firing-rate code in units with broad tuning characteristics. These two stages in the model show interesting similarities with the characteristics of neuron populations shown neurophysiologically in area 7a and parietal region LIP, respectively.},

This robotic head has been designed upon specifications derived from models of the human head and of human neck and eye movements, in terms of total mass, geometry, number of degrees of freedom (d.o.f.), joint velocities and accelerations. The robotic head has 7 d.o.f.: 4 d.o.f. specifically allowing the neck movements and 3 d.o.f. dedicated to the faster eye movements; it has a total mass of approximately 5.6 kg, and it is capable of reaching a maximum eye velocity and acceleration of 1000 degrees/s and 10000 degrees/s(2), respectively, compatible with human data. The coordination of neck and eye movements allows smooth pursuit; and the independent eye yaw movements allow vergence. As an example, the use of this robotic head for validating a novel neurophysiological model of gaze control is presented. The model has been implemented on the robot, which can transform the retina images into their mapping onto the relevant brain area (superior colliculus), calculate the coordinates of a visual stimulus appearing in the periphery, generate the velocity profiles for the eye motors and execute the eye movements. This implementation shows that the robotic head can perform human-like saccades and allows experimental comparison with human data, so as to validate and revise the model itself.

abstract = {Research in the vestibular field has revealed the existence of a central process, called 'velocity storage', that is activated by both visual and vestibular rotation cues and is modified by gravity, but whose functional relevance during natural motion has often been questioned. In this review, we explore spatial orientation in the context of a Bayesian model of vestibular information processing. In this framework, deficiencies/ambiguities in the peripheral vestibular sensors are compensated for by central processing to more accurately estimate rotation velocity, orientation relative to gravity, and inertial motion. First, an inverse model of semicircular canal dynamics is used to reconstruct rotation velocity by integrating canal signals over time. However, its low-frequency bandwidth is limited to avoid accumulation of noise in the integrator. A second internal model uses this reconstructed rotation velocity to compute an internal estimate of tilt and inertial acceleration. The bandwidth of this second internal model is also restricted at low frequencies to avoid noise accumulation and drift of the tilt/translation estimator over time. As a result, low-frequency translation can be erroneously misinterpreted as tilt. The time constants of these two integrators (internal models) can be conceptualized as two Bayesian priors of zero rotation velocity and zero linear acceleration, respectively. The model replicates empirical observations like 'velocity storage' and 'frequency segregation' and explains spatial orientation (e.g., 'somatogravic') illusions. Importantly, the functional significance of this network, including velocity storage, is found during short-lasting, natural head movements, rather than at low frequencies with which it has been traditionally studied.},

A neural network proposed for the SC achieves both spatial and temporal integration of gaze signals. When placing the SC inside a gaze control loop, linear time-space transformations can be achieved even with restricted feedback on the edges of the map. The proposed gaze control model can reproduce all of the properties of previous head-fixed models. However, for the first time, a collicular mechanism is shown to provide plausible explanations for conflicting results upon electrical stimulation of rostral versus caudal sites on the colliculus, and can generate reasonable trajectories for both eye and head platforms in the head-free condition. The key assumption is the distribution of a common motor (gaze) error to the platforms contributing to the movement.},

Even though strong experimental evidence argues for an important role for the CBLM, the most recent models of the saccadic system have relied mostly on the SC for the dynamic control of saccades. In this study, we propose that saccades are controlled by two parallel pathways, one including the SC and the other including the CBLM. In this model, both SC and CBLM provide part of the drive to the saccade. Furthermore, the CBLM receives direct feedback from the brain stem and keeps track of the residual motor error, so that it can issue appropriate commands to compensate for incorrect heading and to end the movement when the target has been foveated. We present here a distributed model that produces realistic saccades and accounts for a great deal of neurophysiological data.},

abstract = {The visual stimulus for a saccadic eye movement is encoded in place-coded maps in cerebral cortex and the dorsal superior colliculus. In contrast, the motor command for the saccade is encoded by the temporal discharge properties of ocular motoneurons and premotor burst neurons in the brain-stem reticular formation. Thus, there is need for a spatial-temporal transformation of neural signals, and recent findings suggest that the superior colliculus might contribute to this process. The ventral, output layers of the superior colliculus encode the metric of the desired saccade in polar coordinates. However, premotor neurons in the pontine and mesencephalic reticular formation are organized to generate horizontal and vertical saccades, respectively. Studies of oblique saccades in patients with slow vertical components--due to Niemann-Pick type C disease--support the interpretation that the saccadic command from the reticular formation is encoded in Cartesian coordinates. Currently, saccades are thought to be generated under local, brain-stem feedback control in which current eye displacement is continuously subtracted from desired eye displacement to compute motor error--the remaining movement required for the eye to acquire the target. If the superior colliculus is positioned in the feedback loop, then there is a need for transformation of premotor signals back into a place-coded version of motor error. Recent studies suggest that, during the saccade, this might be achieved by a wave of activity spreading rostrally, which traverses the collicular map in a direction corresponding to progressively smaller movements and finally activates a group of neurons concerned with fixation. These new hypotheses are ripe for testing by basic and clinical studies. By confronting the issue of what signal transformations are required to program visually guided saccades, new experimental approaches have emerged. Such computational approaches offer insights into how the brain controls behavior not just by measuring stimulus and response, but by asking what "currency" is being used by interacting populations of neurons at any stage in the process.},

abstract = {Internal models are a key feature of most modern theories of motor control. Yet, it has been challenging to localize internal models in the brain, or to demonstrate that they are more than a metaphor. In the present review, I consider a large body of data on the cerebellar floccular complex, asking whether floccular output has features that would be expected of the output from internal models. I argue that the simple spike firing rates of a single group of floccular Purkinje cells could reflect the output of three different internal models. (1) An eye velocity positive feedback pathway through the floccular complex provides neural inertia for smooth pursuit eye movements, and appears to operate as a model of the inertia of real-world objects. (2) The floccular complex processes and combines input signals so that the dynamics of its average simple spike output are appropriate for the dynamics of the downstream brainstem circuits and eyeball. If we consider the brainstem circuits and eyeball as a more broadly conceived "oculomotor plant," then the output from the floccular complex could be the manifestation of an inverse model of "plant" dynamics. (3) Floccular output reflects an internal model of the physics of the orbit where head and eye motion sum to produce gaze motion. The effects of learning on floccular output suggest that it is modeling the interaction of the visually-guided and vestibular-driven components of eye and gaze motion. Perhaps the insights from studying oculomotor control provide groundwork to guide the analysis of internal models for a wide variety of cerebellar behaviors.},

abstract = {1. We have used a combination of eye movement recordings and computer modeling to study long-term adaptive modification (motor learning) in the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR). The eye movement recordings place constraints on possible sites for motor learning. The computer model abides by these constraints, as well as constraints provided by data in previous papers, to formalize a new hypothesis about the sites of motor learning. The model was designed to reproduce as much of the existing neural and behavioral data as possible. 2. Motor learning was induced in monkeys by fitting them with spectacles that caused the gain of the VOR (eye speed divided by head speed) to increase to values > 1.6 or to decrease to values < 0.4. We elicited pursuit by providing ramp motion of a small target at 30 degrees/s along the horizontal axis. Changes in the gain of the VOR caused only small and inconsistent changes in the eye acceleration in the first 100 ms after the onset of pursuit and had no effect on the eye velocity during tracking of steady target motion. Electrical stimulation in the flocculus and ventral paraflocculus with single pulses or trains of pulses caused smooth eye movement toward the side of stimulation after latencies of 9-11 ms. Neither the latency, the peak eye velocity, nor the initial eye acceleration varied as a consistent function of the gain of the VOR. 3. The computer model contained nodes that represented position-vestibular-pause cells (PVP-cells) and flocculus target neurons (FTNs) in the vestibular nucleus, and horizontal gaze-velocity Purkinje cells (HGVP-cells) in the cerebellar flocculus and ventral paraflocculus. Node FTN represented only the "E-c FTNs," which show increased firing for eye motion away from the side of recording. The transfer functions in the model included dynamic elements (filters) as well as static elements (summing junctions, gain elements, and time delays). Except for the transfer functions that converted visual motion inputs into commands for smooth eye movement, the model was linear. 4. The performance of the model was determined both by computer simulation and, for the VOR in the dark, by analytic solution of linear equations. For simulation, we adjusted the parameters by hand to match the output of the model to the eye velocity of monkeys and to match the activity of the relevant nodes in the model to the firing of HGVP-cells, FTNs, and PVP-cells when the gain of the VOR was 0.4, 1.0, and 1.6.},

Anatomic, physiologic, behavioral, and computational approaches have revealed the neural circuits that are used to generate the vestibulo-ocular reflex and have identified two likely sites of plasticity within those circuits. One site of plasticity is in the vestibular inputs to floccular target neurons, which are located in the vestibular nuclei and receive monosynaptic inhibition from Purkinje cells in the floccular complex of the cerebellar cortex. The other site of plasticity is in the vestibular inputs to Purkinje cells in the floccular complex, possibly in the cerebellar cortex. After reviewing the evidence that supports these conclusions, I consider a number of observations showing that the dynamics of neural circuits or cellular mechanisms play important roles in learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex.},

abstract = {Internal models are a key feature of most modern theories of motor control. Yet, it has been challenging to localize internal models in the brain, or to demonstrate that they are more than a metaphor. In the present review, I consider a large body of data on the cerebellar floccular complex, asking whether floccular output has features that would be expected of the output from internal models. I argue that the simple spike firing rates of a single group of floccular Purkinje cells could reflect the output of three different internal models. (1) An eye velocity positive feedback pathway through the floccular complex provides neural inertia for smooth pursuit eye movements, and appears to operate as a model of the inertia of real-world objects. (2) The floccular complex processes and combines input signals so that the dynamics of its average simple spike output are appropriate for the dynamics of the downstream brainstem circuits and eyeball. If we consider the brainstem circuits and eyeball as a more broadly conceived "oculomotor plant," then the output from the floccular complex could be the manifestation of an inverse model of "plant" dynamics. (3) Floccular output reflects an internal model of the physics of the orbit where head and eye motion sum to produce gaze motion. The effects of learning on floccular output suggest that it is modeling the interaction of the visually-guided and vestibular-driven components of eye and gaze motion. Perhaps the insights from studying oculomotor control provide groundwork to guide the analysis of internal models for a wide variety of cerebellar behaviors.},

abstract = {The function of smooth pursuit is to keep the fovea pointed at a small visual target that moves smoothly across a patterned background. Chemical lesions, single cell recordings, and behavioral measures have shown that the cortical motion processing pathways form the afferent limb for pursuit. Important areas include at least the striate cortex and the middle temporal visual area, and probably the medial superior temporal visual area and the posterior parietal cortex. We argue that the visual inputs are transmitted through a simple sensory motor interface in the pons, to the efferent limb in the brain stem and cerebellum. The efferent limb uses neural velocity memory to maintain pursuit automatically. We present evidence that the velocity memory is provided, at least in part, by eye velocity positive feedback between the flocculus of the cerebellum and the brain stem. Finally, we use a computer model to show how the maintenance of pursuit can be simulated on a millisecond time scale. The structure and internal elements of the model are based on the biological experiments reviewed in our paper. In the past five years, progress on the neural basis of pursuit eye movements has been rapid. Several areas of research have made substantial contributions, by using combinations of new and conventional methods. Many of the pathways that contribute to pursuit have been identified, and their physiological activity and functions are becoming understood. Continuing progress promises to yield an understanding of one specific form of visually guided movement, at the level of neuronal circuits and behavior, in the primate.},

abstract = {1. We recorded from neurons in the brain stem of monkeys before and after they had worn magnifying or miniaturizing spectacles to cause changes in the gain of the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR). The gain of the VOR was estimated as eye speed divided by head speed during passive horizontal head rotation in darkness. Electrical stimulation in the cerebellum was used to identify neurons that receive inhibition at monosynaptic latencies from the flocculus and ventral paraflocculus (flocculus target neurons or FTNs). Cells were studied during smooth pursuit eye movements with the head stationary, fixation of different positions, cancellation of the VOR, and the VOR evoked by rapid changes in head velocity. 2. FTNs were divided into two populations according to their responses during pursuit with the head stationary. The two groups showed increased firing during smooth eye motion toward the side of recording (Eye-ipsiversive or E-i) or away from the side of recording (Eye-contraversive or E-c). A higher percentage of FTNs showed increased firing rate for contraversive pursuit when the gain of the VOR was high (> or = 1.6) than when the gain of the VOR was low (< or = 0.4). 3. Changes in the gain of the VOR had a striking effect on the responses during the VOR for the FTNs that were E-c during pursuit with the head stationary. Firing rate increased during contraversive VOR eye movements when the gain of the VOR was high or normal and decreased during contraversive VOR eye movements when the gain of the VOR was low. Changes in the gain of the VOR caused smaller changes in the responses during the VOR of FTNs that were E-i during pursuit with the head stationary. We argue that motor learning in the VOR is the result of changes in the responses of individual FTNs. 4. The responses of E-i and E-c FTNS during cancellation of the VOR depended on the gain of the VOR. Responses tended to be in phase with contraversive head motion when the gain of the VOR was low and in phase with ipsiversive head motion when the gain of the VOR was high. Comparison of the effect of motor learning on the responses of FTNs during cancellation of the VOR with the results of similar experiments on horizontal-gaze velocity Purkinje cells in the flocculus and ventral paraflocculus suggests that the brain stem vestibular inputs to FTNs are one site of motor learning in the VOR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements allow primates to fixate and track small, slowly moving objects. Pursuit usually requires visual targets; our aim was to determine the properties of the visual signals transmitted to the pursuit motor system. Rhesus monkeys were rewarded for tracking spots of light that underwent discreet changes in velocity under a variety of visual conditions. We measured the resulting smooth eye acceleration in a 100-msec interval that began with the initiation of pursuit and ended before there had been time for visual feedback. This approach allowed us to vary the parameters of visual stimulation and measure eye movement responses in a way that provides estimates of the properties of signals transmitted by visual pathways. The initiation of pursuit showed different properties early and late in the interval we studied. In the first 20 msec of pursuit, eye acceleration was in the correct direction, but was independent of the initial position of the moving images, the velocity of the stimulus, or the presence or absence of background illumination. Thereafter, the initiation of pursuit depended strongly on all of the above parameters. Eye acceleration was highest when the moving images fell close to the fovea and decreased sharply as eccentricity was increased up to 21 degrees. When the background was diffusely illuminated, eye acceleration showed velocity selectivity; it was highest for a middle range of velocities (30 to 60 degrees/sec) and decreased for higher velocities. When the background was dark, eye acceleration increased as a function of target velocity up to 150 degrees/sec. We conclude that the initiation of pursuit has at least 2 visual components. The two components have different latencies and show quite different relationships to the visual properties of the stimulus, suggesting two cell populations that could provide the visual inputs for pursuit.},

Sensory-motor and motor circuits have both housekeeping and modulatory functions, implemented in the cerebellum and the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields. The representation of pursuit is quite different in these two regions of the brain, but both regions seem to control pursuit directly with little or no noise added downstream.

abstract = {Each voluntary eye movement provides physical evidence of a visuomotor choice about where and when to look. Primates choose visual targets with two types of voluntary eye movements, pursuit and saccades, although the exact mechanism underlying their coordination remains unknown. Are pursuit and saccades guided by the same decision signal? The present study compares pursuit and saccadic choices using techniques borrowed from psychophysics and models of response time. Human observers performed a luminance discrimination task and indicated their choices with eye movements. Because the stimuli moved horizontally and were offset vertically, subjects' tracking responses consisted of combinations of both pursuit and saccadic eye movements. For each of two signal strengths, we constructed speed-accuracy curves for pursuit and saccades. We found that speed-accuracy curves for pursuit and saccades have the same shape, but are time-shifted with respect to one another. We argue that this pattern occurs because pursuit and saccades share a decision signal, but utilize different response thresholds and are subject to different motor processing delays.},

abstract = {Tracking a single target in the visual world requires coordination between pursuit and saccadic eye movements. The constraints imposed on pursuit and saccade decisions by visual processing and response preparation are difficult to compare because latency differences between the two movements provide different amounts of visual sampling time. The present study compares pursuit and saccade decisions when visual processing was directly manipulated. Human observers were asked to select between two stationary stimuli presented simultaneously at two different locations based on which had the higher contrast. The stimuli were presented for a brief, variable interval and then occluded by masks. Because the masks moved horizontally and were offset vertically, subjects were obliged to make both pursuit and saccadic eye movements to track the mask covering the target stimulus. For each of the exposure durations, we constructed oculometric curves for pursuit and saccades. We found that both systems had similar oculometric thresholds and response biases. The initial pursuit decisions differed from the subsequent saccade decisions on 1-13\% of the trials but were the same more often than predicted by independent mechanisms. Moreover, pursuit reversed direction on discordant trials, so that the pursuit decision always matched that of the saccade by the time the saccade was started. These results support the view that, in addition to overlap in early visual areas and the final motor pathways, the pursuit and saccadic systems share processing at the level of response preparation. This shared processing may help ensure the coordination of pursuit and saccadic eye movements in selecting a single target.},

The covert selection of sensory information for perception is often thought to be accomplished mostly by the cerebral cortex, whereas the overt orienting toward relevant stimuli involves various additional structures such as the superior colliculus, a subcortical region involved in the control of eye movements. Contrary to this view, we show that the superior colliculus is necessary for determining which stimuli will inform perceptual judgments, even in the absence of orienting movements. Reversible inactivation of the superior colliculus in monkeys performing a motion discrimination task caused profound inattention for stimuli in the affected visual field, but only when distracters containing counterinformative signals appeared in the unaffected field. When distracting stimuli contained no information, discrimination performance was largely unaffected. Thus, the superior colliculus is a bottleneck in the covert selection of signals for perceptual judgments.},

We concentrate on six of these: the frontal eye field, parietal eye field, supplementary eye field, middle superior temporal area, prefrontal eye field, and area 7 m (precuneus in humans). In each of these regions: (1) there is neural activity closely related to eye movements; (2) electrical microstimulation produces or modifies eye movements; (3) surgical lesions or chemical inactivation impairs eye movements; (4) there are direct neural projections to major structures in the brainstem oculomotor system; and (5) increased activity is observed during eye movement tasks in functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography experiments in humans. Each of these eye fields is reciprocally connected with the other eye fields, and each receives visual information directly from visual association cortex. Each eye field has distinct subregions that are concerned with either saccadic or pursuit eye movements. The saccadic subregions are preferentially interconnected with other saccade subregions and the pursuit subregions are preferentially interconnected with other pursuit subregions. Current evidence strongly supports the proposal that there are parallel cortico-cortical networks that control purposeful saccadic and pursuit eye movements, and that the activity in those networks is modulated by feedback information, via the thalamus, from the superior colliculus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.},

abstract = {We examined the effects of changing spatial aspects of attention during oculomotor tracking. Human subjects were instructed to make a discrimination on either the small (0.8??) central or the large (8??) peripheral part of a compound stimulus (two counter-rotating concentric rings) while the stimulus either translated across the screen or was stationary. During this period, a transient perturbation with either step or ramp movement profile occurred. For perturbations leading to a change in position larger than the small ring, saccades occurred more frequently and had much shorter latencies (by 135 ms) when attention was directed to the small ring than when attention was directed to the large ring. These latency differences were sufficiently great that from a single saccade one can identify the attentional instruction with 94\% accuracy. However, with target steps as small as the small ring, saccade latencies differed less. For pursuit, ramp perturbations caused larger changes in eye velocity with little change in latency when attention was directed to the small ring. Finally, when only the motion of the non-attended ring was perturbed, most subjects showed stronger saccadic responses to perturbations of the small than the large ring, and stronger pursuit responses to perturbations of the large than the small ring. By fitting the saccade latency distributions with the Reddi and Carpenter LATER model, we found that our subjects apparently employed at least two distinct strategies for changing latency when attending large vs. small. We propose that the timing of the saccade decision process depends on both the size of the attended object and the magnitude of the perturbation. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The brain builds dynamic models of the body and the outside world to predict the consequences of actions and stimuli. A well-known example is the oculomotor integrator, which anticipates the position-dependent elasticity forces acting on the eye ball by mathematically integrating over time oculomotor velocity commands. Many models of neural integration have been proposed, based on feedback excitation, lateral inhibition or intrinsic neuronal nonlinearities. We report here that a computational model of the cerebellar cortex, a structure thought to implement dynamic models, reveals a hitherto unrecognized integrator circuit. In this model, comprising Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons and parallel fibres, Purkinje cells were able to generate responses lasting more than 10 s, to which both neuronal and network mechanisms contributed. Activation of the somatic fast sodium current by subthreshold voltage fluctuations was able to maintain pulse-evoked graded persistent activity, whereas lateral inhibition among Purkinje cells via recurrent axon collaterals further prolonged the responses to step and sine wave stimulation. The responses of Purkinje cells decayed with a time-constant whose value depended on their baseline spike rate, with integration vanishing at low (< 1 per s) and high rates (> 30 per s). The model predicts that the apparently fast circuit of the cerebellar cortex may control the timing of slow processes without having to rely on sensory feedback. Thus, the cerebellar cortex may contain an adaptive temporal integrator, with the sensitivity of integration to the baseline spike rate offering a potential mechanism of plasticity of the response time-constant.},

abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of executing fast gaze shifts toward a visual target with a robotic platform. The robotic platform is an anthropomorphic head with seven degrees of freedom (DOFs) that was designed to mimic the physical dimensions (i.e. geometry and masses), the performances (i.e. angles and velocities) and the functional abilities (i.e. neck-movements and eyes vergence) of the human head. In our approach the "gold performance" of the robotic head is represented by the accurate eye-head coordination that is observed during head-free gaze saccades in humans. To this aim, we implemented and tested on the robotic head a well-characterized, biologically inspired model of gaze control and we investigate the effectiveness of the bioinspired paradigm to achieve an appropriate control of the multi-DOF robotic head. Moreover, in order to verify if the proposed model can reproduce the typical patterns of actual human movements, we performed a quantitative investigation of the relation between movement amplitude, duration and peak velocity. In the latter case, we compared the actual robot performances with existing data on human main sequence which is known to provide a general method for quantifying the dynamic of oculomotor control. The obtained results confirmed (1) the ability of the proposed bioinspired control to achieve and maintain and stable fixation of the target which was always well-positioned within the fovea and (2) the ability to reproduce the typical human main sequence diagrams which were never been successfully implemented on a fully anthropomorphic head. Even if fundamentally aimed at the experimental investigation of the underlying neurophysiologic models, the present study is also intended to provide some possible relevant solutions to the development of human-like eye movements in humanoid robots.},

abstract = {In the previous paper (Mano et al, 1991), we reported the discharge patterns of saccade-related Purkinje cells during visually guided saccade task, which were recorded from posterior cerebellar hemisphere, the Crus IIa. In the present study, we analysed these P-cell's simple spike activity during the spontaneous saccade in inter-trial intervals (ITI) of visually guided saccade task, comparing with the activity during the visually guided saccade. We found that the modulation of simple spike discharges during spontaneous saccade was weaker than the modulation during the visually triggered saccade. We recorded single unit discharges of Purkinje cells from cerebellar posterior hemisphere (Crus IIa) in awake Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata), trained to perform simple reaction time saccade task gazing at a small light rear-projected on to a tangent screen 54 cm in front of the monkey. Horizontal and vertical eye positions were measured by a corneal search coil method. Comparison of simple spike activity associated with spontaneous saccade during ITI to the activity during visually triggered saccade clarified that the discharge patterns of simple spikes are basically the same during both types of the saccades, but the amount of the phasic modulation (increase of decrease of discharge rate) were larger for all directions (up, down, left and right) during visually guided saccade than that during spontaneous saccade in all saccade-related Purkinje cells so far examined in two monkeys. The modulation, however, cannot be assumed to have been induced by the visual stimulus per se. Because, the maximum increase of simple spike discharge rate aligned at saccade onset is larger than that aligned at target jump. And, the half width of the change was wider when aligned at target light jump than when aligned at the onset of saccades, in all the four directions, indicating the changes of the firing rate were more time-locked to the onset of saccadic eye movements than to the triggering visual stimulus. The present findings suggest that the cerebellar hemisphere plays a more important role in the control of externally triggered voluntary eye movements than in the control of self-initiated, self-paced eye movements. We discussed these findings combining with previous findings on limb movement-related P-cells (Mano et al, 1980, 1986, 1989), from view point of the general role of the cerebellar hemisphere in the control of voluntary movements.},

abstract = {Peri-saccadic perception experiments have revealed a multitude of mislocalization phenomena. For instance, a briefly flashed stimulus is perceived closer to the saccade target, whereas a displacement of the saccade target goes usually unnoticeable. This latter saccadic suppression of displacement has been explained by a built-in characteristic of the perceptual system: the assumption that during a saccade, the environment remains stable. We explored whether the mislocalization of a briefly flashed stimulus toward the saccade target also grounds in the built-in assumption of a stable environment. If the mislocalization of a peri-saccadically flashed stimulus originates from a post-saccadic alignment process, an additional location marker at the position of the upcoming flash should counteract compression. Alternatively, compression might be the result of peri-saccadic attentional phenomena. In this case, mislocalization should occur even if the position of the flashed stimulus is marked. When subjects were asked about their perceived location, they mislocalized the stimulus toward the saccade target, even though they were fully aware of the correct stimulus location. Thus, our results suggest that the uncertainty about the location of a flashed stimulus is not inherently relevant for compression.},

abstract = {Saccades are typically separated by inter-saccadic fixation intervals (ISFIs) of > or =125 ms. During this time, the saccadic system selects a goal and completes the preparatory processes required prior to executing the subsequent movement. However, in tasks in which competing stimuli are presented, two sequentially executed movements to different goals can be separated by much shorter ISFIs. This suggests that the saccadic system is capable of completing many of the preparatory requirements for a second saccade concurrently with the execution of an initial movement. We recorded single neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) during rapid saccade sequences made by rhesus monkeys performing a search task. We found that during the execution of an initial saccade, activity related to the goal of a quickly following second saccade can be simultaneously maintained in the SC motor map. This activity appears to signal the selection or increased salience of the second saccade goal even before the initial saccade has ended. For movements separated by normal ISFIs (> or =125 ms), we did not observe activity related to concurrent processing, presumably because for these longer ISFI responses, the goal of the second saccade is not selected until after the end of the first saccade. These results indicate that, at the time of an initial saccade, the SC does not necessarily act as a strict winner-take-all network. Rather it appears that the salience of a second visual goal can be simultaneously maintained in the SC. This provides evidence that selection or preparatory activity related to the goal of a second saccade can overlap temporally with activity related to an initial saccade and indicates that such concurrent processing is present even in a structure which is fairly close to the motor output.},

abstract = {We recorded the simple-spike (SS) firing of Purkinje cells (PCs) in the floccular complex both during normal pursuit caused by step-ramp target motions and after learning induced by a consistently timed change in the direction of target motion. The encoding of eye movement by the SS firing rate of individual PCs was described by a linear regression model, in which the firing rate is a sum of weighted components related to eye acceleration, velocity, and position. Although the model fit the data well for individual conditions, the regression coefficients for the learned component of firing often differed substantially from those for normal pursuit of step-ramp target motion. We suggest that the different encoding of learned versus normal pursuit responses in individual PCs reflects different amounts of learning in their inputs. The decoded output from the floccular complex, estimated by averaging responses across the population of PCs, also was fitted by the regression model. Regression coefficients were equal for the two conditions for on-direction pursuit, but differed for off-direction target motion. We conclude that the average output from the population of floccular PCs provides some, but not all, of the neural signals that drive the learned component of pursuit and that plasticity outside of the flocculus makes an important contribution.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We aim to understand how mechanical causation influences retinal detachment and reattachment processes. In particular, myopes suffer retinal detachment more frequently than emmetropes, and following a retinal detachment, scleral buckling promotes retinal reattachment. We test the hypothesis that stresses arising from saccadic eye rotations are involved in the processes, and that the alteration in the stress due to the change in the vitreous chamber geometry is sufficient to explain the phenomena.

METHODS: The vitreous chamber of the eye has an approximately spherical shape and it is filled with vitreous humor. We developed a mathematical model, treating the vitreous chamber in emmetropic and myopic eyes as a spheroid and in eyes subjected to scleral buckling as a sphere with a circumferential indentation. We assume that the eye performs prescribed small-amplitude, periodic, torsional rotations and we solve semi-analytically for the fluid pressure, velocity, and stress distributions.

RESULTS: The shape of the vitreous chamber has a large effect on the retinal stress. The vitreous and the retina of a highly myopic eye continuously experience shear stresses significantly higher than those of an emmetropic eye. An eye fitted with a scleral buckle experiences large stress levels localized around the buckle.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a mechanical explanation for the more frequent occurrence of posterior vitreous detachment and retinal detachment in myopic eyes. To understand how the stress distribution in a buckled eye facilitates reattachment, an additional model of the details of the reattachment process should be coupled to this model.},

abstract = {The vestibulo-ocular reflex functions to prevent head movements from disturbing retinal images by generating compensatory eye movements to offset the head movements. In the monkey--the species mainly under consideration here--this reflex is machine-like and very effective. In the short-term, the VOR operates as an open-loop control system without the benefit of feedback and its performance is fixed and immutable: No matter what pattern of eye-head coordination the animal uses to view external objects, there is a continuing need for the VOR and it continues to operate; however, should the VOR consistently fail to stabilize the retinal images during head turns, it will gradually undergo long-term adaptive gain changes that restore, that stability. This adaptive capability is ultimately dependent upon vision, and a variety of optical devices that disturb the visual input normally associated with lead turns have been used to induce large changes in the reflex. Insofar as the monkey is concerned, all of the available evidence suggests to us that the modifiable elements underlying these long-term adjustments are located in the brainstem vestibular pathways and not, as previously suggested by others, in the floccular lobes of the cerebellum. However, the flocculus does appear to have an important, inductive role in the adaptive process providing at least part of the error signal guiding the long-term adjustments in the brainstem. In our view, the VOR is a particularly well-defined example of a plastic system and promises to be a most useful model for studying the cellular mechanisms underlying memory and learning the central nervous system.},

The gains of both control actions are adapted in order to provide optimal dynamic response for unknown arbitrary target trajectories. Inverse differential kinematics is evaluated so that human-like joint motions are achieved. To exploit kinematic redundancy, a weighted pseudoinverse is realized that takes into account different optimization criteria. Additional self-motions of the head are also considered.

We review the stages through which pulley theory has developed, distinguishing passive, coordinated, weak differential, and strong differential pulley theories and focusing on points of controversy. There is overwhelming evidence that much of the eye's kinematics, once thought to require brainstem coordination of EOM innervations, is determined by orbital biomechanics. The main criticisms of pulley theory only apply to the strong differential theory, abandoned in 2002. Critiques of the notion of dual EOM insertions are shown to be mistaken. The role of smooth muscle and the issue of rotational noncommutativity are clarified. We discuss how pulley sleeves can be stabilized as required by the theory, noting that more work needs to be done in specifying the tissues involved.},

abstract = {Soft tissue "pulleys" in the orbit alter the paths of the eye muscles in a way that may simplify the brain's work in implementing Listing's law, i.e., in holding ocular torsion at zero. But Listing's law does not apply to some oculomotor systems, such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR), which shows a different kinematic pattern. To explain this different pattern, some authors have assumed that the pulleys must adopt a different configuration, retracting along their muscles when the eye switches from Listing's law to VOR mode. The proposed retraction has not so far been observed, although the pulleys do move in other ways. We show that the hypothetical retraction of the pulleys would not in fact explain the full kinematic pattern seen in the VOR. But this pattern can be explained entirely on the basis of pulley positions and motions that have actually been observed. If one takes into account the neural processing within the VOR, specifically the fact that the reflex is weak in the torsional dimension, then a single mode of pulley action can serve both vestibuloocular kinematics and Listing's law.},

If the purpose of the VOR is simply to stabilize the retinal image, there can be no such dependence, because eye velocity must always be equal and opposite to head velocity. But if the VOR tolerates some retinal slip to achieve other goals, such as reducing eye velocity or following Listing's law, then one should see specific patterns of dependence. We examined VOR responses of human subjects to yaw, pitch, and roll rotation looking in various directions to quantify how the input-output properties of the VOR vary with eye position. 2. Eye rotation axes during yaw and pitch tilted in the same direction as the gaze line but only one-quarter as far on average. Thus, during yaw head rotation, the axis of eye rotation was roughly aligned with the head axis when the subject looked straight ahead, but tilted up when the gaze direction was up, and down when gaze was down. The amount of tilt varied between subjects, but on average a 30 degrees change in eye position caused a 7.5 degrees tilt in the eye rotation axis. During pitch, the eye axis tilted right when gaze was right and left when gaze was left, also moving 7.5 degrees on average for a 30 degrees change in the gaze direction. 3. During roll stimulation, the axis of eye rotation tilted in the opposite direction to the gaze line, and about one-half as far. On average, when the gaze line moved 30 degrees down, the eye rotation axis tilted 12.0 degrees up; when the gaze moved 30 degrees left, the eye axis tilted 15.3 degrees right. 4. It is often argued that the torsional VOR is weak because head rotation about the line of sight causes little image displacement on the fovea. But the line of sight is collinear with the torsional axis only when the subject looks straight ahead. Does the "weak axis" of the VOR stay collinear with the gaze line when the subject looks eccentrically? We calculated the axis of head rotation for which the VOR response is weakest and found that it does vary with eye position, but does not stay parallel with the gaze direction. When subjects looked straight ahead, the weak axis was roughly collinear with the gaze line; when gaze shifted eccentrically, the weak axis shifted in the same direction but only about one-half as far.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {We examined two ways in which the neural control system for eye-head saccades constrains the motion of the eye in the head. The first constraint involves Listing's law, which holds ocular torsion at zero during head-fixed saccades. During eye-head saccades, does this law govern the eye's motion in space or in the head? Our subjects, instructed to saccade between space-fixed targets with the head held still in different positions, systematically violated Listing's law of the eye in space in a way that approximately, but not perfectly, preserved Listing's law of the eye in head. This finding implies that the brain does not compute desired eye position based on the desired gaze direction alone but also considers head position. The second constraint we studied was saturation, the process where desired-eye-position commands in the brain are "clipped" to keep them within an effective oculomotor range (EOMR), which is smaller than the mechanical range of eye motion. We studied the adaptability of the EOMR by asking subjects to make head-only saccades. As predicted by current eye-head models, subjects failed to hold their eyes still in their orbits. Unexpectedly, though, the range of eye-in-head motion in the horizontal-vertical plane was on average 31\% smaller in area than during normal eye-head saccades, suggesting that the EOMR had been reduced by effort of will. Larger reductions were possible with altered visual input: when subjects donned pinhole glasses, the EOMR immediately shrank by 80\%. But even with its reduced EOMR, the eye still moved into the "blind" region beyond the pinhole aperture during eye-head saccades. Then, as the head movement brought the saccade target toward the pinhole, the eyes reversed their motion, anticipating or roughly matching the target's motion even though it was still outside the pinhole and therefore invisible. This finding shows that the backward rotation of the eye is timed by internal computations, not by vision. When subjects wore slit glasses, their EOMRs shrank mostly in the direction perpendicular to the slit, showing that altered vision can change the shape as well as the size of the EOMR. A recent, three-dimensional model of eye-head coordination can explain all these findings if we add to it a mechanism for adjusting the EOMR.},

abstract = {When visually fixating targets on an isovergence surface, the position of each eye was constrained to a plane. Thus, Listing's law holds during vergence. The planes were, however, rotated temporally with respect to those when viewing distant targets. The effect of this rotation was to produce a torsion which depended on eye elevation; extorsion of the two eyes for downward gaze and intorsion for upward gaze. The saccadic velocity command was relatively unaffected during vergence. Computer simulations suggest that the saccadic tonic command and the vergence command interact multiplicatively in three dimensions.},

abstract = {Saccades are imprecise, due to sensory and motor noise. To avoid an accumulation of errors during sequences of saccades, a prediction derived from the efference copy can be combined with the reafferent visual feedback to adjust the following eye movement. By varying the information quantity of the visual feedback, we investigated how the reliability of the visual information affects the postsaccadic update in humans. Two elements of the visual scene were manipulated, the saccade target or the background, presented either together or in isolation. We determined the weight of the postsaccadic visual information by measuring the effect of intrasaccadic visual shifts on the following saccade. We confirmed that the weight of visual information evolves with information quantity as predicted for a statistically optimal system. In particular, we found that the visual background alone can guide the postsaccadic update, and that information from target and background are optimally combined. Moreover, these visual weights are adjusted dynamically and on a trial-to-trial basis to the level of visual noise determined by target eccentricity and reaction time. In contrast, we uncovered a dissociation between the visual signals used to update the next planned saccade (main saccade) and those used to generate an involuntary corrective saccade. The latter was exclusively based on visual information about the target, and discarded all information about the background: a suboptimal use of visual evidence.},

abstract = {The subcortical saccade-generating system consists of the retina, superior colliculus, cerebellum and brainstem motoneuron areas. The superior colliculus is the site of sensory-motor convergence within this basic visuomotor loop preserved throughout the vertebrates. While the system has been extensively studied, there are still several outstanding questions regarding how and where the saccade eye movement profile is generated and the contribution of respective parts within this system. Here we construct a spiking neuron model of the whole intermediate layer of the superior colliculus based on the latest anatomy and physiology data. The model consists of conductance-based spiking neurons with quasi-visual, burst, buildup, local inhibitory, and deep layer inhibitory neurons. The visual input is given from the superficial superior colliculus and the burst neurons send the output to the brainstem oculomotor nuclei. Gating input from the basal ganglia and an integral feedback from the reticular formation are also included.We implement the model in the NEST simulator and show that the activity profile of bursting neurons can be reproduced by a combination of NMDA-type and cholinergic excitatory synaptic inputs and integrative inhibitory feedback. The model shows that the spreading neural activity observed in vivo can keep track of the collicular output over time and reset the system at the end of a saccade through activation of deep layer inhibitory neurons. We identify the model parameters according to neural recording data and show that the resulting model recreates the saccade size-velocity curves known as the saccadic main sequence in behavioral studies. The present model is consistent with theories that the superior colliculus takes a principal role in generating the temporal profiles of saccadic eye movements, rather than just specifying the end points of eye movements.},

abstract = {1. We have investigated the role of retinal and extraretinal signals in the initiation and maintenance of smooth-pursuit eye movements in trained rhesus monkeys. Visual targets were presented in open-loop conditions by using electronic feedback of eye position to form the command for target position. This allowed us to present stimuli that were stabilized with respect to the moving eye or to provide small, precisely controlled retinal position or velocity errors. 2. Pursuit was maintained with only small decreases in eye velocity if retinal errors were eliminated by stabilizing the tracking target in front of the fovea during pursuit at 15 degrees/s. This argues that the pursuit system employs "velocity memory" to maintain pursuit. We suggest that velocity memory is effected by an extraretinal signal derived from positive feedback of eye-velocity commands. 3. Small retinal position errors caused smooth eye accelerations if imposed during pursuit, but were ineffective for initiating the transition from steady fixation to pursuit. Small retinal velocity errors were effective both for initiating pursuit from steady fixation and for altering eye velocity during pursuit. 4. Retinal position errors were effective at changing smooth eye velocity in a variety of conditions that required prior activation of the pursuit system. These include pursuit with or without a stationary background, pursuit with a background that was stabilized with respect to the eye, pursuit with combined eye and head motion (cancellation of the vestibuloocular reflex), and use of pursuit to suppress optokinetic nystagmus. Position errors were ineffective during fixation of stationary targets, even if head motion was provided to evoke the smooth eye velocity of the vestibuloocular reflex. 5. We conclude that retinal position errors are effective only after the pursuit system has been activated. It follows that pursuit initiation involves an active transition from steady fixation and that this transition is normally triggered by retinal velocity errors but not by retinal position errors.},

abstract = {1. In the monkey superior colliculus (SC), the activity of most saccade-related neurons studied so far consists of a burst of activity in a population of cells at one place on the SC movement map. In contrast, recent experiments in the cat have described saccade-related activity as a slow increase in discharge before saccades followed by a hill of activity moving across the SC map. In order to explore this striking difference in the distribution of activity across the SC, we recorded from all saccade-related neurons that we encountered in microelectrode penetrations through the monkey SC and placed them in categories according to their activity during the generation of saccades. 2. When we considered the activity preceding the onset of the saccade, we could divide the cells into two categories. Cells with burst activity had a high-frequency discharge just before saccade onset but little activity between the signal to make a saccade and saccade onset. About two thirds of the saccade-related cells had only a burst of activity. Cells with a buildup of activity began to discharge at a low frequency after the signal to make a saccade and the discharge continued until generation of the saccade. About one third of the saccade-related cells studied had a buildup of activity, and about three fourths of these cells also gave a burst of activity with the saccade in addition to the slow buildup of activity. 3. The buildup of activity seemed to be more closely related to preparation to make a saccade than to the generation of the saccade. The buildup developed even in cases when no saccade occurred. 4. The falling phase of the discharge of these saccade-related cells stopped with the end of the saccade (a clipped discharge), shortly after the end of the saccade (partially clipped), or long after the end of the saccade (unclipped). 5. Some cells had closed movement fields in which saccades that were substantially smaller or larger than the optimal amplitude were not associated with increased activity. Other cells tended to have open-ended movement fields without any peripheral border; they were active for all saccades of optimal direction whose amplitudes were equal to or greater than a given amplitude.},

We studied the role of the superior colliculus (SC) in the control of visual fixation by recording from cells in the rostral pole of the SC in awake monkeys that were trained to perform fixation and saccade tasks. 2. We identified a subset of neurons in three monkeys that we refer to as fixation cells. These cells increased their tonic discharge rate when the monkey actively fixated a visible target spot to obtain a reward. This sustained activity persisted when the visual stimulation of the target spot was momentarily removed but the monkey was required to continue fixation. 3. The fixation cells were in the rostral pole of the SC. As the electrode descended through the SC, we encountered visual cells with foveal and parafoveal receptive fields most superficially, saccade-related burst cells with parafoveal movement fields below these visual cells, and fixation cells below the burst cells. From this sequence in depth, the fixation cells appeared to be centered in the deeper reaches of the intermediate layers, and this was confirmed by small marking lesions identified histologically. 4. During saccades, the tonically active fixation cells showed a pause in their rate of discharge. The duration of this pause was correlated to the duration of the saccade.

abstract = {1. In the companion paper we described two classes of cells in the monkey superior colliculus (SC) that were related to saccade generation, buildup cells and burst cells, which fell into two functional sublayers within the intermediate layers of the SC. Fixation cells in the rostral SC were deemed to be part of the buildup cell layer. The buildup cells had several characteristics in common with cells in the cat described as having a "hill of activity" moving across the SC, but the burst cells had no such characteristics. In this paper we further investigate whether there is evidence for such a moving hill of activity in the monkey by analyzing the spatial and temporal activity of cells across the SC during the generation of visually guided saccades. 2. We recorded the activity of single cells while the monkey made saccades of different amplitudes (0.5-60 degrees). We recorded cells from locations extending from the rostral to caudal SC in order to sample cells whose optimal amplitudes ranged from small to large saccades. This allowed us to see any shift of activity across the SC before, during, and after saccades. It also allowed us to determine the fraction of the SC that was active during the successive phases of saccade generation. 3. During active visual fixation, the fixation cells in the rostral pole of the buildup layer showed an increased discharge rate. From the population reconstruction, we estimate that the zone of active cells spanned the most rostral 0.72 mm in each SC. Assuming the SC is 5 mm in length, approximately 15\% of the cells lying along the horizontal meridian in the buildup layer would be active during fixation. 4. At least 100 ms before the initiation of a saccade, long-lead activity began to appear in the buildup layer at the site on the SC motor map related to the next saccade. Fixation activity in the rostral poles simultaneously began to diminish, but the cells in the burst layer remained relatively silent. 5. Approximately 25 ms before saccade onset, the fixation cells ceased firing and both burst and buildup cells began to burst. The active zone in the burst layer was estimated to be approximately 1.4 mm diam, occupying roughly 28\% of the SC along a line running from the rostral pole through the center of the initially active zone. The size of this active area among the burst cells was independent of saccade amplitude.},

We tested the hypothesis that a subset of neurons, which we have referred to as fixation cells, located within the rostral pole of the monkey superior colliculus (SC) controls the generation of saccadic eye movements. We altered the activity of these neurons with either electrical stimulation or GABAergic drugs. 2. An increase in the activity of fixation cells in the rostral SC, induced by a train of low-frequency electrical stimulation, delayed the initiation of saccades. With bilateral stimulation the monkey was able to make saccades only after stimulation ceased. 3. Pulses of stimulation delivered during the saccade produced an interruption of the saccade in midflight. The latency to the onset of this perturbation was as short as 12 ms. 4. Injection of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist bicuculline into the rostral pole of the SC, which decreases normal GABA inhibition and increases cell activity, increased the latency of saccades to both visual and remembered targets. 5. Injection of the GABA agonist muscimol into the rostral SC, which increases normal GABA inhibition and decreases activity, reduced the latency for saccades to visual targets. The monkey also had difficulty maintaining visual fixation and suppressing unwanted saccades. 6. After muscimol injections, monkeys frequently made very short-latency saccades forming a peak in the saccade latency histogram at < 100 ms. These saccades are similar to express saccades made by normal monkeys. This finding suggests that the fixation cells in the rostral SC are critical for controlling the frequency of express saccades. 7. These results support the hypothesis that fixation cells in the rostral SC inhibit the generation of saccadic eye movements and that they form part of a system of oculomotor control, that of visual fixation.},

abstract = {Fast and accurate motor behavior requires combining noisy and delayed sensory information with knowledge of self-generated body motion; much evidence indicates that humans do this in a near-optimal manner during arm movements. However, it is unclear whether this principle applies to eye movements. We measured the relative contributions of visual sensory feedback and the motor efference copy (and/or proprioceptive feedback) when humans perform two saccades in rapid succession, the first saccade to a visual target and the second to a memorized target. Unbeknownst to the subject, we introduced an artificial motor error by randomly "jumping" the visual target during the first saccade. The correction of the memory-guided saccade allowed us to measure the relative contributions of visual feedback and efferent copy (and/or proprioceptive feedback) to motor-plan updating. In a control experiment, we extinguished the target during the saccade rather than changing its location to measure the relative contribution of motor noise and target localization error to saccade variability without any visual feedback. The motor noise contribution increased with saccade amplitude, but remained <30\% of the total variability. Subjects adjusted the gain of their visual feedback for different saccade amplitudes as a function of its reliability. Even during trials where subjects performed a corrective saccade to compensate for the target-jump, the correction by the visual feedback, while stronger, remained far below 100\%. In all conditions, an optimal controller predicted the visual feedback gain well, suggesting that humans combine optimally their efferent copy and sensory feedback when performing eye movements.},

abstract = {1. We investigated cells in the middle temporal visual area (MT) and the medial superior temporal area (MST) that discharged during smooth pursuit of a dim target in an otherwise dark room. For each of these pursuit cells we determined whether the response during pursuit originated from visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target or from an extraretinal input related to the pursuit movement itself. We distinguished between these alternatives by removing the visual motion stimulus during pursuit either by blinking off the visual target briefly or by stabilizing the target on the retina. 2. In the foveal representation of MT (MTf), we found that pursuit cells usually decreased their rate of discharge during a blink or during stabilization of the visual target. The pursuit response of these cells depends on visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target. 3. In a dorsal-medial region of MST (MSTd), cells continued to respond during pursuit despite a blink or stabilization of the pursuit target. The pursuit response of these cells is dependent on an extraretinal input. 4. In a lateral-anterior region of MST (MST1), we found both types of pursuit cells; some, like those in MTf, were dependent on visual inputs whereas others, like those in MSTd, received an extraretinal input. 5. We observed a relationship between pursuit responses and passive visual responses. MST cells whose pursuit responses were attributable to extraretinal inputs tended to respond preferentially to large-field random-dot patterns. Some cells that preferred small spots also had an extraretinal input. 6. For 92\% of the pursuit cells we studied, the pursuit response began after onset of the pursuit eye movement. A visual response preceding onset of the eye movement could be observed in many of these cells if the initial motion of the target occurred within the visual receptive field of the cell and in its preferred direction. In contrast to the pursuit response, however, this visual response was not dependent on execution of the pursuit movement. 7. For the remaining 8\% of the pursuit cells, the pursuit discharge began before initiation of the pursuit eye movement. This occurred even though the initial motion of the target was outside the receptive field as mapped during fixation trials. Our data suggest, however, that such responses may be attributable to an expansion of the receptive field that accompanies enhanced visual responses.},

abstract = {Frontal-eyed primates use both smooth pursuit in frontoparallel planes (frontal pursuit) and pursuit-in-depth (vergence pursuit) to track objects moving slowly in 3-dimensional (3D) space. To understand how 3D-pursuit signals represented in frontal eye fields are processed further by downstream pathways, monkeys were trained to pursue a spot moving in 3D virtual space. We characterized pursuit signals in Purkinje (P) cells in the cerebellar dorsal vermis and their discharge during vergence pursuit. In 41\% of pursuit P-cells, 3D-pursuit signals were observed. However, the majority of vermal-pursuit P-cells (59\%) discharged either for vergence pursuit (43\%) or for frontal pursuit (16\%). Moreover, the majority (74\%) of vergence-related P-cells carried convergence signals, displaying both vergence eye position and velocity sensitivity during sinusoidal and step vergence eye movements. Preferred frontal-pursuit directions of vergence + frontal-pursuit P-cells were distributed in all directions. Most pursuit P-cells (73\%) discharged before the onset of vergence eye movements; the median lead time was 16 ms. Muscimol infusion into the sites where convergence P-cells were recorded resulted in a reduction of peak convergence eye velocity, of initial convergence eye acceleration, and of frontal-pursuit eye velocity. These results suggest involvement of the dorsal vermis in conversion of 3D-pursuit signals and in convergence eye movements.},

We compared saccade metrics and dynamics evoked at each site independently with those caused by sequential presentation and collisions of the two stimulation trains. Essentially, we forced controlled spatio-temporal patterns of activity into the saccade control circuit with various timing relationships from known sites within the collicular motor map, thus revealing the spatio-temporal transformation from superior colliculus to eye movement dynamics under experimentally controlled conditions. We extend prior findings about decreasing time intervals between sequential presentations of stimulations to include mid-flight combinations and dynamic modifications of trajectory. We explore how asynchronous collisions between two movements systematically engage a normalization mechanism of movement metrics, and demonstrate how dynamic patterns of activity across the SC motor map can create mid-flight curvature of movement through the post-collicular dynamics of a displacement controller. The explicit control addresses feasibility for systems control models and provides benchmark data for experimental verification of model mechanisms.},

We tested whether SC activity plays a role in this initial stage of orienting by inactivating the SC in two macaques (Macaca mulatta) with local muscimol injections. After SC inactivation, initial orienting responses still followed a vector average, but the contribution of the visual stimulus inside the affected field was decreased, and the contribution of the stimulus outside the affected field was increased. These results demonstrate that the SC plays an important role in the weighted integration of visual signals for orienting, in addition to its role in the winner-take-all selection of the target.},

abstract = {The anatomical connection between the frontal eye field and the cerebellar hemispheric lobule VII (H-VII) suggests a potential role of the hemisphere in voluntary eye movement control. To reveal the involvement of the hemisphere in smooth pursuit and saccade control, we made a unilateral lesion around H-VII and examined its effects in three Macaca fuscata that were trained to pursue visually a small target. To the step (3 degrees)-ramp (5-20 degrees/s) target motion, the monkeys usually showed an initial pursuit eye movement at a latency of 80-140 ms and a small catch-up saccade at 140-220 ms that was followed by a postsaccadic pursuit eye movement that roughly matched the ramp target velocity. After unilateral cerebellar hemispheric lesioning, the initial pursuit eye movements were impaired, and the velocities of the postsaccadic pursuit eye movements decreased. The onsets of 5 degrees visually guided saccades to the stationary target were delayed, and their amplitudes showed a tendency of increased trial-to-trial variability but never became hypo- or hypermetric. Similar tendencies were observed in the onsets and amplitudes of catch-up saccades. The adaptation of open-loop smooth pursuit velocity, tested by a step increase in target velocity for a brief period, was impaired. These lesion effects were recognized in all directions, particularly in the ipsiversive direction. A recovery was observed at 4 wk postlesion for some of these lesion effects. These results suggest that the cerebellar hemispheric region around lobule VII is involved in the control of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements.},

abstract = {1. The ability of the central nervous system to compensate for saccadic dysmetria was demonstrated in rhesus monkeys. The behavior of this adaptive mechanism after cerebellar ablations was examined. 2. Monkeys were trained to fixate small target lights. Eye movements were monitored while the animals were seated, with their heads fixed, in a rotating magnetic field. The horizontal recti muscles of one eye were weakened by tenectomy. Saccades made by this weakened eye were hypometric and followed by postsaccadic drift. 3. When the patch was switched so that the weak eye was viewing, the hypometric saccades made by the weak eye gradually became larger, until after 3 days they were essentially orthometric. This indicated that the central nervous system could compensate for a peripheral weakness. 4. The tenectomy operation reduced the strength of the muscles, creating hypometria, and upset the ratio of viscosity to elasticity in the orbit, creating postsaccadic drift in the weak eye. The innervation required to make a saccade has both phasic and tonic components, the so-called pulse and step. The sacccadic repair mechanism increased both the pulse and the step to compensate for the hypometria and also adjusted the ratio of the pulse to the step to eliminate postsaccadic drift. 5. Total cerebellectomies were performed on two monkeys, each of which had one tenectomized eye. These ablations created an enduring saccadic hypermetria and postsaccadic drift in the unoperated eye of both animals. The total cerebellectomy abolished all adaptive repair of the saccadic system. 6. Partial cerebellectomies were performed on two monkeys, each of which had one tenectomized eye. Lesions of the vermis and paravermis (lobes IV-IX) and the fastigial nuclei created an enduring saccadic hypermetria without postsaccadic drift in the unoperated eye of both animals. These lesions abolished adaptive control of the pulse of innervation. Adaptive changes in the step of innervation still occurred, so that postsaccadic drift was always eliminated in the experienced, viewing eye. Thus the midline cerebellum (vermis, paravermis, and fastigial nuclei) appears to be important for repair of saccadic dysmetria, but not for repair of postsaccadic drift. Additional evidence that postsaccadic retinal slip cannot be compensated for in flocculectomized monkeys suggest that the adaptive control of the step may depend on the flocculus. 7. After cerebellar lesions the monkeys were able to make saccades of all amplitudes and directions. The principal deficit in these animals seemed to be that the pulse and step of innervation were no longer appropriate to the target displacement. We conclude that the cerebellum's principal contribution to saccadic eye movements is the adjustment of the gains of the pulse- and step-generating mechanisms. Hence this study supports the hypothesis that repair of dysmetria is a general function of the cerebellum.},

abstract = {Visually guided movements require the brain to perform a sensorimotor transformation. The key to understanding this transformation is to understand the different roles of the superior colliculus (SC) and cerebellum (CB). The SC has a three-layered structure. Cells in the top layer have visual, but not motor, responses. However, cells in the deeper layers have both visual and motor responses. Thus, for a long time it was thought that the SC encoded both the retinal location of a sensory stimulus and the desired change in eye movement needed to acquire it. However, copious evidence has accumulated that shows that the SC encodes only the retinal location of a visual target, and not the movement needed to foveate it. Thus, the information needed to make accurate movements must come from another part of the brain, which is proposed to be the cerebellum. Here it is shown how the cerebellum could perform the sensorimotor transformation.},

abstract = {How does the brain tell the eye where to go? Classical models of rapid eye movements are lumped control systems that compute analogs of physical signals such as desired eye displacement, instantaneous error, and motor drive. Components of these lumped models do not correspond well with anatomical and physiological data. We have developed a more brain-like, distributed model (called a neuromimetic model), in which the superior colliculus (SC) and cerebellum (CB) play novel roles, using information about the desired target and the movement context to generate saccades. It suggests that the SC is neither sensory nor motor; rather it encodes the desired sensory consequence of the saccade in retinotopic coordinates. It also suggests a non-computational scheme for motor control by the cerebellum, based on context learning and a novel spatial mechanism, the pilot map. The CB learns to use contextual information to initialize the pilot signal that will guide the saccade to its goal. The CB monitors feedback information to steer and stop the saccade, and thus replaces the classical notion of a displacement integrator. One consequence of this model is that no desired eye movement signal is encoded explicitly in the brain; rather it is distributed across activity in both the SC and CB. Another is that the transformation from spatially coded sensory information to temporally coded motor information is implicit in the velocity feedback loop around the CB. No explicit spatial-to-temporal transformation with a normalization step is needed.},

abstract = {To evaluate the nature and possible sources of variation in sensory-motor behavior, we measured the signal-to-noise ratio for the initiation of smooth-pursuit eye movements as a function of time and computed thresholds that indicate how well the pursuit system discriminates small differences in the direction, speed, or time of onset of target motion. Thresholds improved rapidly as a function of time and came close to their minima during the interval when smooth eye movement is driven only by visual motion inputs. Many features of the data argued that motor output and sensory discrimination are limited by the same noise source. Pursuit thresholds reached magnitudes similar to those for perception: <2-3 degrees of direction, approximately 11-15\% of target speed, and 8 ms of change in the time of onset of target motion. Pursuit and perceptual thresholds had similar dependencies on the duration of the motion stimulus and showed similar effects of target speed. The evolution of information about direction of target motion followed the same time course in pursuit behavior and in a previously reported sample of neuronal responses from extrastriate area MT. Changing the form of the sensory input while keeping the motor response fixed had significant effects on the signal-to-noise ratio in pursuit for direction discrimination, whereas holding the sensory input constant while changing the combination of muscles used for the motor output did not. We conclude that noise in sensory processing of visual motion provides the major source of variation in the initiation of pursuit.},

abstract = {To probe how the brain integrates visual motion signals to guide behavior, we analyzed the smooth pursuit eye movements evoked by target motion with a stochastic component. When each dot of a texture executed an independent random walk such that speed or direction varied across the spatial extent of the target, pursuit variance increased as a function of the variance of visual pattern motion. Noise in either target direction or speed increased the variance of both eye speed and direction, implying a common neural noise source for estimating target speed and direction. Spatial averaging was inefficient for targets with >20 dots. Together these data suggest that pursuit performance is limited by the properties of spatial averaging across a noisy population of sensory neurons rather than across the physical stimulus. When targets executed a spatially uniform random walk in time around a central direction of motion, an optimized linear filter that describes the transformation of target motion into eye motion accounted for approximately 50\% of the variance in pursuit. Filters had widths of approximately 25 ms, much longer than the impulse response of the eye, and filter shape depended on both the range and correlation time of motion signals, suggesting that filters were products of sensory processing. By quantifying the effects of different levels of stimulus noise on pursuit, we have provided rigorous constraints for understanding sensory population decoding. We have shown how temporal and spatial integration of sensory signals converts noisy population responses into precise motor responses.},

abstract = {Electrophysiological and electrical stimulation studies in the monkey have disclosed that both the retinal surface and the metrics of saccades are topographically represented in the superior colliculus. This mapping of sensory and motor space onto the colliculus is nonhomogeneous in that the central region is over-represented in both the visual and the motor map. Single unit studies have revealed that visual receptive fields of collicular neurons are typically quite large and are characterized by a skewed (asymmetrical) sensitivity profile. Analyses by McIlwain [J. Neurophysiol. 38, 219-230 (1975)] in the cat have suggested that this skewness property reflects mainly the spatial distortion inherent in the afferent mapping. In this paper we describe a quantitative model, based on a logarithmic mapping function combined with a Gaussian connectivity function in the colliculus, which can account for the extent and the shape of collicular receptive fields. Collicular neurons in the deeper layers have movement-related bursts of activity for saccades in a limited amplitude and direction range related to their location in the collicular map. These movement fields, like visual receptive fields, may be quite extensive and typically have a skewed profile. In our model, an efferent-mapping function is defined, which relates the locus of a population of recruited cells to the metrics of the ensuing saccade. The parameters of this function, which was taken to be identical with the afferent mapping function, were estimated from Robinson's [Vision Res. 12, 1795-1808 (1972)] electrical stimulation data. Based on the assumption that the population-activity profile resembles a two-dimensional Gaussian function, the shape and the size of movement fields can then be described with just 2 or 3 free parameters. Electrophysiological data recorded from a small sample of collicular visuomotor neurons were used to illustrate the procedure, which we designed to enable application of our model to the experimental data. The best fit was obtained when the mapping function was slightly anisotropic. Suggestions on how the model could be improved and extended are offered in the Discussion.},

Behavioural data collected in healthy and brain-damaged subjects, and neurophysiological data from non human primates, will be reviewed in an attempt to build a coherent picture of saccadic adaptation mechanisms. Emphasis will further be put on the contextual factors of saccadic adaptation, and on the link between adaptive changes of oculomotor commands and visual perception. It will be shown that saccadic adaptation relies on multiple mechanisms according to experimental contexts, time-scales, saccade categories, and direction of adaptive changes of saccade amplitude (shortening versus lengthening). Taking into account this complexity will be a key toward a comprehensive understanding of the physiopathology of saccadic adaptation and toward the development of possible rehabilitation procedures. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The cerebellar areas involved in the control of saccades have recently been identified in the medio-posterior cerebellum (MPC). Unit activity recordings, experimental lesions and electrical microstimulation of this region in cats and monkeys have provided a considerable amount of data and allowed the development of new computational models. In this paper, we review these data and concepts about cerebellar function, discuss their importance and limitations and suggest future directions for research. The anatomical data indicate that the MPC has more than one site of action in the visuo-oculomotor system. In contrast, most models emphasize the role of cerebellar connections with immediate pre-oculomotor circuits in the reticular formation, and only one recent model also incorporates the ascending projections of the MPC to the superior colliculus. A major challenge for future studies, in continuation with this initial attempt, is to determine whether the various cerebellar output pathways correspond to distinct contributions to the control of saccadic eye movements. Also, a series of recent studies in the cat have indicated a more general role of the MPC in the control of orienting movements in space, calling for an increasing effort to the study of the MPC in the production of head-unrestrained saccadic gaze shifts.},

abstract = {The primate visual system faces a difficult problem whenever it encounters the motion of an object moving over a patch of the retina. Objects typically contain a number of edges at different orientations and so a range of image velocities are generated within the receptive field of a neuron processing the object movement. It is still a mystery as to how these different velocities are combined into one unified and correct velocity. Neurons in area MT (V5) are considered to be the neural substrate for this motion integration process. Some MT neurons (pattern type) respond selectively to the correct global motion of an object, whereas others respond primarily to the individual components making up the pattern (component type). Recent findings from MT pattern cells tested with small patches of motion (N. J. Majaj, M. Carandini, \& J. A. Movshon, 2007) have put further constraints on the possible mechanisms underlying MT pattern motion integration. We tested and refined an existing model of MT pattern neurons (J. A. Perrone, 2004) using these same small patch stimuli and found that it can accommodate these new findings. We also discovered that the speed of the test stimuli may have had an impact on the N. J. Majaj et al. (2007) results and that MT direction and speed tuning may be more closely linked than previously thought.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the biomechanical deformation of the cornea resulting from tissue cutting and removal by use of a new computational model and to investigate the effect of mechanical anisotrophy resulting from the fibrillar architecture.

SETTING: Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.

METHODS: A mathematical model for a typical lamella that explicitly accounts for the strain energy of the collagen fibrils, extrafibrillar matrix, and proteoglycan cross-linking was developed. A stromal model was then obtained by generalized averaging of the lamella properties through the stromal thickness, taking into account the preferred orientations of the collagen fibrils, which were obtained from x-ray scattering data.

RESULTS: The model was used to predict astigmatism induced by a tunnel incision in the sclera, such as is used for cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. The amount of induced cylinder was in good agreement with published clinical data. Results show it is important for the model to incorporate preexisting corneal physiological stress caused by intraocular pressure.

CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical model described appears to provide a framework for further development, capturing the essential features of mechanical anisotropy of the cornea. The tunnel incision simulation indicated the importance of the anisotropy in this case.},

abstract = {The superior colliculus (SC) of the monkey has been shown to be involved in not only initiation of saccades but in the selection of the target to which the saccade can be directed. The present experiments examine whether SC neuronal activity related to target selection is also related to saccade generation. In an asynchronous target task, the monkey was required to make a saccade to the first of two spots of light to appear. Using choice probability analysis over multiple trials, we determined the earliest time at which neurons in the SC intermediate layers indicated target selection. We then determined how closely the neuronal selection was correlated to saccade onset by using our asynchronous reaction time task, which allowed the monkey to make a saccade to the target as soon as the selection had been made. We found that the selection became evident at widely differing times for different neurons. Some neurons indicated target selection just before the saccade (close to the pre-saccadic burst of activity), others did so at the time of the visual response, and some showed an increase in their activity even before the target appeared. A fraction of this pre-stimulus bias resulted from a priming effect of the previous trial; a saccade to the target in the movement field on the previous trial produced both a higher level of neuronal activity and a higher probability for a saccade to that target on the current trial. We found that most of the neurons (76\%) showed a correlation between selection time and reaction time. Furthermore, within this 76\% of neurons, many indicated a selection very early during the visual response. There was no evidence of a sequence from target selection first and saccade selection later, but rather that target selection and saccade initiation are intertwined and are probably inseparable.},

abstract = {Experimental evidence indicates that the superior colliculus (SC) is important but neither necessary nor sufficient to produce accurate saccadic eye movements. Furthermore both clinical and experimental evidence points to the cerebellum as an indispensable component of the saccadic system. Accordingly, we have devised a new model of the saccadic system in which the characteristics of saccades are determined by the cooperation of two pathways, one through the SC and the other through the cerebellum. Both pathways are influenced by feedback information: the feedback determines the decay of activity for collicular neurons and the timing of the activation for cerebellar neurons. We have modeled three types of cells (burst, buildup, and fixation neurons) found in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus. We propose that, from the point of view of motor execution, the burst neurons and the buildup neurons are not functionally distinct with both providing a directional drive to the brain stem circuitry. The fixation neurons determine the onset of the saccade by disfacilitating the omnipause neurons in the brain stem. Excluding noise-related variations, the ratio of the horizontal to the vertical components of the collicular drive is fixed throughout the saccade (i.e., its direction is fixed); the duration of the drive is such that it always would produce hypermetric movements. The cerebellum plays three roles: first, it provides an additional directional drive, which improves the acceleration of the eyes; second, it keeps track of the progress of the saccade toward the target; and third, it ends the saccade by choking off the collicular drive. The drive provided by the cerebellum can be adjusted in direction to exert a directional control over the saccadic trajectory. We propose here a control mechanism that incorporates a spatial displacement integrator in the cerebellum; under such conditions, we show that a partial directional control arises automatically. Our scheme preserves the advantages of several previous models of the saccadic system (e.g., the lack of a spatial-to-temporal transformation between the SC and the brain stem; the use of efference copy feedback to control the saccade), without incurring many of their drawbacks, and it accounts for a large amount of experimental data.},

abstract = {One-dimensional models of oculomotor control rely on the fact that, when rotations around only one axis are considered, angular velocity is the derivative of orientation. However, when rotations around arbitrary axes [3-dimensional (3-D) rotations] are considered, this property does not hold, because 3-D rotations are noncommutative. The noncommutativity of rotations has prompted a long debate over whether or not the oculomotor system has to account for this property of rotations by employing noncommutative operators. Recently, Raphan presented a model of the ocular plant that incorporates the orbital pulleys discovered, and qualitatively modeled, by Miller and colleagues. Using one simulation, Raphan showed that the pulley model could produce realistic saccades even when the neural controller is commutative. However, no proof was offered that the good behavior of the Raphan-Miller pulley model holds for saccades different from those simulated. We demonstrate mathematically that the Raphan-Miller pulley model always produces movements that have an accurate dynamic behavior. This is possible because, if the pulleys are properly placed, the oculomotor plant (extraocular muscles, orbital pulleys, and eyeball) in a sense appears commutative to the neural controller. We demonstrate this finding by studying the effect that the pulleys have on the different components of the innervation signal provided by the brain to the extraocular muscles. Because the pulleys make the axes of action of the extraocular muscles dependent on eye orientation, the effect of the innervation signals varies correspondingly as a function of eye orientation. In particular, the Pulse of innervation, which in classical models of the saccadic system encoded eye velocity, here encodes a different signal, which is very close to the derivative of eye orientation. In contrast, the Step of innervation always encodes orientation, whether or not the plant contains pulleys. Thus the Step can be produced by simply integrating the Pulse. Particular care will be given to describing how the pulleys can have this differential effect on the Pulse and the Step. We will show that, if orbital pulleys are properly located, the neural control of saccades can be greatly simplified. Furthermore, the neural implementation of Listing's Law is simplified: eye orientation will lie in Listing's Plane as long as the Pulse is generated in that plane. These results also have implications for the surgical treatment of strabismus.},

abstract = {Models of the oculomotor plant (globe, muscles, pulleys, and orbital tissues) fall into three categories: 1). one-dimensional dynamic with lumped plant elements, 2). three-dimensional dynamic with lumped plant elements, or 3). three-dimensional static with distinct plant elements. The second class of models is most often used when studying the neural control of 3-D eye movement, because they best represent the plant dynamics. However, they are often faulted because they make two unrealistic assumptions: 1). muscle pairs act along the three orthogonal axes (symmetry assumption); and 2). the force generated by the muscles depends only on their innervation (force assumption). It turns out that the symmetry assumption is quite benign, because in a realistic model of the plant the deviations from orthogonal axes can be easily accounted for by simple adjustments to the innervation. In contrast, the force assumption introduces some serious problems. In the present paper, the authors show that a realistic, dynamic model of the geometry of the orbit, with independent muscles, makes different predictions than a similar model with lumped muscles. This difference arises because muscle force is a function of both innervation and muscle length.},

abstract = {The viscoelastic properties of passive eye muscles are prime determinants of the deficits observed following eye muscle paralysis, the root cause of several types of strabismus. Our limited knowledge about such properties is hindering the ability of eye plant models to assist in formulating a patient's diagnosis and prognosis. To investigate these properties we conducted an extensive in vivo study of the mechanics of passive eye muscles in deeply anesthetized and paralyzed monkeys. We describe here the static length-tension relationship and the transient forces elicited by small step-like elongations. We found that the static force increases nonlinearly with length, as previously shown. As expected, an elongation step induces a fast rise in force, followed by a prolonged decay. The time course of the decay is however considerably more complex than previously thought, indicating the presence of several relaxation processes, with time constants ranging from 1 ms to at least 40 s. The mechanical properties of passive eye muscles are thus similar to those of many other biological passive tissues. Eye plant models, which for lack of data had to rely on (erroneous) assumptions, will have to be updated to incorporate these properties.},

The complexity inherent in rheological measurements makes it desirable to present the results in terms of a mathematical model. Because Fung's quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model has been particularly successful in capturing the viscoelastic properties of passive biological tissues, here we analyze this dataset within the framework of Fung's theory.We found that the basic properties assumed under the QLV theory (separability and superposition) are not typical of passive eye muscles. We show that some recent extensions of Fung's model can deal successfully with the lack of separability, but fail to reproduce the deviation from superposition.While appealing for their elegance, the QLV model and its descendants are not able to capture the complex mechanical properties of passive eye muscles. In particular, our measurements suggest that in a passive extraocular muscle the force does not depend on the entire length history, but to a great extent is only a function of the last elongation to which it has been subjected. It is currently unknown whether other passive biological tissues behave similarly.},

This led us to conclude that Fung's quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model, and more general nonlinear models based on a single convolution integral, cannot faithfully mimic passive eye muscles. Here we present additional data about the mechanical properties of passive eye muscles in deeply anesthetized monkeys. We show that, in addition to the aforementioned failures, previous models also grossly overestimate the force exerted by passive eye muscles during smooth elongations similar to those experienced during normal eye movements. Importantly, we also show that the force exerted by a muscle following an elongation is largely independent of the elongation itself, and it is mostly determined by the final muscle length. These additional findings conclusively rule out the use of classical viscoelastic models to mimic the mechanical properties of passive eye muscles. We describe here a new model that extends previous ones using principles derived from research on thixotropic materials. This model is able to account reasonably well for our data, and could thus be incorporated into models of the eye plant.},

abstract = {We have extensively investigated the mechanical properties of passive eye muscles, in vivo, in anesthetized and paralyzed monkeys. The complexity inherent in rheological measurements makes it desirable to present the results in terms of a mathematical model. Because Fung's quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model has been particularly successful in capturing the viscoelastic properties of passive biological tissues, here we analyze this dataset within the framework of Fung's theory.We found that the basic properties assumed under the QLV theory (separability and superposition) are not typical of passive eye muscles. We show that some recent extensions of Fung's model can deal successfully with the lack of separability, but fail to reproduce the deviation from superposition.While appealing for their elegance, the QLV model and its descendants are not able to capture the complex mechanical properties of passive eye muscles. In particular, our measurements suggest that in a passive extraocular muscle the force does not depend on the entire length history, but to a great extent is only a function of the last elongation to which it has been subjected. It is currently unknown whether other passive biological tissues behave similarly.},

abstract = {{Important aspects of present-day humanoid robot research is to make such robots look realistic and human-like, both in appearance, as well as in motion and mannerism. In this paper, we focus our study on advanced control leading to realistic motion coordination for a humanoid's robot neck and eyes while tracking an object. The motivating application for such controls is conversational robotics, in which a robot head ``actor\{''\} should be able to detect and make eye contact with a human subject. Therefore, in such a scenario, the 3D position and orientation of an object of interest in space should be tracked by the redundant head-eye mechanism partly through its neck, and partly through its eyes. In this paper, we propose an optimization approach, combined with a real-time visual feedback to generate the realistic robot motion and robustify it. We also offer experimental results showing that the neck-eye motion obtained from the proposed algorithm is realistic comparing to the head-eye motion of humans.\}},

@article{Ramat2007,
abstract = {Saccades are rapid eye movements that redirect the fovea from one object to another. A great deal has been learned about the anatomy and physiology of saccades, making them an ideal system for studying the neural control of movement. Basic research on normal eye movements has greatly increased our understanding of saccadic performance, anatomy and physiology, and led to a large number of control system models. These models simulate normal saccades well, but are challenged by clinical disorders because they often do not incorporate the specific anatomical and physiological substrates needed to model clinically important abnormalities. Historically, studies of saccadic abnormalities in patients have played a critical role in understanding the neural control of saccades because they provide information that complements basic research and thus restricts hypotheses to those that are biologically plausible. This review presents four examples of clinical disorders (slow saccades, interrupted saccades, high-frequency saccadic oscillations and macrosaccadic oscillations) that have provided insights into the neurobiology of saccades, have driven the development of new models, and have suggested an explanation or treatment for these disorders. We raise general questions for both scientists and clinicians that will assist in their efforts to understand the neural control of movement, improve diagnostic criteria and develop new treatments.},

@article{Raphan1998,
abstract = {This study evaluates the effects of muscle axis shifts on the performance of a vector velocity-position integrator in the CNS. Earlier models of the oculomotor plant assumed that the muscle axes remained fixed relative to the head as the eye rotated into secondary and tertiary eye positions. Under this assumption, the vector integrator model generates torsional transients as the eye moves from secondary to tertiary positions of fixation. The torsional transient represents an eye movement response to a spatial mismatch between the torque axes that remain fixed in the head and the displacement plane that changes by half the angle of the change in eye orientation. When muscle axis shifts were incorporated into the model, the torque axes were closer to the displacement plane at each eye orientation throughout the trajectory, and torsional transients were reduced dramatically. Their size and dynamics were close to reported data. It was also shown that when the muscle torque axes were rotated by 50\% of the eye rotation, there was no torsional transient and Listing's law was perfectly obeyed. When muscle torque axes rotated >50\%, torsional transients reversed direction compared with what occurred for muscle axis shifts of <50\%. The model indicates that Listing's law is implemented by the oculomotor plant subject to a two-dimensional command signal that is confined to the pitch-yaw plane, having zero torsion. Saccades that bring the eye to orientations outside Listing's plane could easily be corrected by a roll pulse that resets the roll state of the velocity-position integrator to zero. This would be a simple implementation of the corrective controller suggested by Van Opstal and colleagues. The model further indicates that muscle axis shifts together with the torque orientation relationship for tissue surrounding the eye and Newton's laws of motion form a sufficient plant model to explain saccadic trajectories and periods of fixation when driven by a vector command confined to the pitch-yaw plane. This implies that the velocity-position integrator is probably realized as a subtractive feedback vector integrator and not as a quaternion-based integrator that implements kinematic transformations to orient the eye.},

@article{Reyes-Puerta2011,
abstract = {One must be quick and precise when foveating targets to be reached, because the eyes have to guide the hand trajectory by visual feedback, and we may miss a rapidly moving target if our grasping is not fast and accurate enough. To this end, our brains developed mechanisms coordinating gaze and hand movements to optimize the way in which we foveate and reach. One of these mechanisms is the facilitation of the primary saccade--proven in humans and confirmed here in monkeys--which allows the generation of short-latency gaze movements when reaching towards visual targets. Here we tested whether the neuronal activity in the superior colliculus (SC) accounts for this mechanism; alternatively, cortical saccade-related areas could play a major role in the fast initiation of saccades during such elaborated behaviours bypassing the SC. Upon presentation of a target, neurons located at the rostral pole of the SC started the saccade-related pause in their activity earlier in tasks involving coordinated gaze-reach movements than in tasks in which the saccades were made in isolation. In the same tasks neurons located at the caudal SC reached peak firing rates earlier in coordinated gaze-reach movements than with isolated saccades, confirming the tight coupling between their burst activity latencies and the saccadic reaction times. In sum, our results extend the role of the SC in saccade initiation to coordinated gaze-reach movements, identifying its activity as an important part of the distributed neural system for eye-hand coordination.},

@article{Rolfs2010,
abstract = {Our actions need constant calibration to arrive accurately at locations of their intended goals; errors in execution must drive rapid adjustments. As an example, saccadic eye movements are vital for bringing objects of interest into the high-acuity center of vision and they must be continually tuned to compensate for ongoing changes in body, muscle strength and neural variability. This adaptation of eye movement responses can be induced artificially by systematically displacing the saccade targets by a constant proportion during each saccade. Observers do not notice these shifts and yet the oculomotor system does, rapidly compensating for the landing error until the saccades finally land close to the artificially displaced target. This recalibration has been described as spatially selective, dropping off with distance in direction and amplitude from the adapted saccade vector. However, we now report that this local adaptation property is a consequence of adapting to only one direction at a time, the method generally used in previous studies. When we induced adaptation in all directions, using a quasi-random walk where each target was displaced 25\% back toward to the previous fixation, we found strong, spatially generalized adaptation that could not be accounted for by an accumulation of many vector-specific adaptations. This global adaptation is a plausible strategy for calibration given the absence of any obvious growth changes or muscle deficits that would lead to vector specific losses and it provides a robust model for testing motor calibration.},

At the same time, researchers have suggested several neural models to underly the generation of saccades, but these do not include online learning as a mechanism of optimization. Here, we suggest an open-loop neural controller with a local adaptation mechanism that minimizes a proposed cost function. Simulations show that the characteristics of coordinated eye and head movements generated by this model match the experimental data in many aspects, including the relationship between amplitude, duration and peak velocity in head-restrained and the relative contribution of eye and head to the total gaze shift in head-free conditions.

abstract = {The primate visual system consists of at least two processing streams, one passing ventrally into temporal cortex that is responsible for object vision, and the other running dorsally into parietal cortex that is responsible for spatial vision. How information from these two streams is combined for perception and action is not understood. Visually guided eye movements require information about both feature identity and location, so we investigated the topographic organization of visual cortex connections with frontal eye field (FEF), the final stage of cortical processing for saccadic eye movements. Multiple anatomical tracers were placed either in parietal and temporal cortex or in different parts of FEF in individual macaque monkeys. Convergence from the dorsal and ventral processing streams occurred in lateral FEF but not in medial FEF. Certain extrastriate areas with retinotopic visual field organizations projected topographically onto FEF. The dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus projected to medial FEF; the ventral bank, to lateral FEF, and the fundus, throughout FEF. Thus, lateral FEF, which is responsible for generating short saccades, receives visual afferents from the foveal representation in retinotopically organized areas, from areas that represent central vision in inferotemporal cortex and from other areas having no retinotopic order. In contrast, medial FEF, which is responsible for generating longer saccades, is innervated by the peripheral representation of retinotopically organized areas, from areas that emphasize peripheral vision or are multimodal and from other areas that have no retinotopic order or are auditory.},

@article{Schlag1987,
abstract = {Electrical microstimulation and unit recording were performed in dorsomedial frontal cortex of four alert monkeys to identify an oculomotor area whose existence had been postulated rostral to the supplementary motor area. Contraversive saccades were evoked from 129 sites by stimulation. Threshold currents were lower than 20 microA in half the tests. Response latencies were usually longer than 50 ms (minimum: 30 ms). Eye movements were occasionally accompanied by blinks, ear, or neck movements. The cortical area yielding these movements was at the superior edge of the frontal lobe just rostral to the region from which limb movements could be elicited. Depending on the site of stimulation, saccades varied between two extremes: from having rather uniform direction and size, to converging toward a goal defined in space. The transition between these extremes was gradual with no evidence that these two types were fundamentally different. From surface to depth of cortex, direction and amplitude of evoked saccades were similar or changed progressively. No clear systematization was found depending on location along rostrocaudal or mediolateral axes of the cortex. The dorsomedial oculomotor area mapped was approximately 7 mm long and 6 mm wide. Combined eye and head movements were elicited from one of ten sites stimulated when the head was unrestrained. In the other nine cases, saccades were not accompanied by head rotation, even when higher currents or longer stimulus trains were applied. Presaccadic unit activity was recorded from 62 cells. Each of these cells had a preferred direction that corresponded to the direction of the movement evoked by local microstimulation. Presaccadic activity occurred with self-initiated as well as visually triggered saccades. It often led self-initiated saccades by more than 300 ms. Recordings made with the head free showed that the firing could not be interpreted as due to attempted head movements. Many dorsomedial cortical neurons responded to photic stimuli, either phasically or tonically. Sustained responses (activation or inhibition) were observed during target fixation. Twenty-one presaccadic units showed tonic changes of activity with fixation. Justification is given for considering the cortical area studied as a supplementary eye field. It shares many common properties with the arcuate frontal eye field. Differences noted in this study include: longer latency of response to electrical stimulation, possibility to evoke saccades converging apparently toward a goal, and long-lead unit activity with spontaneous saccades.},

@article{Schnabolk1994,
abstract = {1. A considerable amount of attention has been devoted to understanding the velocity-position transformation that takes place in the control of eye movements in three dimensions. Much of the work has focused on the idea that rotations in three dimensions do not commute and that a "multiplicative quaternion model" of velocity-position integration is necessary to explain eye movements in three dimensions. Our study has indicated that this approach is not consistent with the physiology of the types of signals necessary to rotate the eyes. 2. We developed a three-dimensional dynamical system model for movement of the eye within its surrounding orbital tissue. The main point of the model is that the eye muscles generate torque to rotate the eye. When the eye reaches an orientation such that the restoring torque of the orbital tissue counterbalances the torque applied by the muscles, a unique equilibrium point is reached. The trajectory of the eye to reach equilibrium may follow any path, depending on the starting eye orientation and eye velocity. However, according to Euler's theorem, the equilibrium reached is equivalent to a rotation about a fixed axis through some angle from a primary orientation. This represents the shortest path that the eye could take from the primary orientation in reaching equilibrium. Consequently, it is also the shortest path for returning the eye to the primary orientation. Thus the restoring torque developed by the tissue surrounding the eye was approximated as proportional to the product of this angle and a unit vector along this axis. The relationship between orientation and restoring torque gives a unique torque-orientation relationship. 3. Once the appropriate torque-orientation relationship for eye rotation is established the velocity-position integrator can be modeled as a dynamical system that is a direct extension of the one-dimensional velocity-position integrator. The linear combination of the integrator state and a direct pathway signal is converted to a torque signal that activates the muscles to rotate the eyes. Therefore the output of the integrator is related to a torque signal that positions the eyes. It is not an eye orientation signal. The applied torque signal drives the eye to an equilibrium orientation such that the restoring torque equals the applied torque but in the opposite direction. The eye orientation reached at equilibrium is determined by the unique torque-orientation relation. Because torque signals are vectors, they commute.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

As long as the eyes stay still, corresponding features are confined to narrow bands called epipolar lines. But when the eyes change position, the epipolar lines migrate on the retinas. To find the matching features, the brain must either search different retinal bands depending on current eye position, or search retina-fixed zones that are large enough to cover all usual locations of the epipolar lines. Here we show, using a new type of stereogram in which the depth image vanishes at certain gaze elevations, that the search zones are retina-fixed. This being the case, motor control acquires a crucial function in depth vision: we show that the eyes twist about their lines of sight in a way that reduces the motion of the epipolar lines, allowing stereopsis to get by with smaller search zones and thereby lightening its computational load.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This paper focuses on motor learning within the saccadic and vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) oculomotor systems, vital for our understanding how the brain keeps these subsystems calibrated in the presence of disease, trauma, and the changes that invariably accompany normal development and aging. We will concentrate on new information related to multiple time scales of saccade motor learning, adaptation of the VOR during high-velocity impulses, and the role of saccades in VOR adaptation. The role of the cerebellum in both systems is considered.

METHODS: Review of data involving saccade and VOR motor learning.

RESULTS: Data supports learning within the saccadic and VOR oculomotor systems is influenced by 1). Multiple time scales, with different rates of both learning and forgetting (seconds, minutes, hours, days, and months). In the case of forgetting, relearning on a similar task may be faster. 2). Pattern of training, learning and forgetting are not similarly achieved. Different contexts require different motor behaviors and rest periods between training sessions can be important for memory consolidation.

CONCLUSIONS: The central nervous system has the difficult task of determining where blame resides when motor performance is impaired (the credit assignment problem). Saccade and VOR motor learning takes place at multiple levels within the nervous system, from alterations in ion channel and membrane properties on single neurons, to more complex changes in neural circuit behavior and higher-level cognitive processes including prediction.},

abstract = {In the 16 years since we last summarized the behavior of the premotor elements that control saccades, research has revealed shortcomings in previous formulations of the control mechanisms of the brainstem saccadic burst generator. Specifically, complexities in the eye movement plant, a more detailed knowledge of the behaviors of certain bursting neurons, and previously undiscovered anatomical connections have broadened our knowledge but have generated new questions that require rethinking previous concepts. Perhaps the most crucial revelations/insights have come from studies that have implicated the superior colliculus and the midline cerebellum as crucial elements of the burst generator. In summarizing these recent findings here, we have been led to conclude that the superior colliculus issues the saccadic command and receives feedback from the brainstem burst generators, but the feedback does not control saccade size. In addition, the midline cerebellum also contains a feedback path, but only as part of a more generalized circuit that serves multiple functions.},

@book{Shadmehr2012,
abstract = {In " Biological Learning and Control," Reza Shadmehr and Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi present a theoretical framework for understanding the regularity of the brain's perceptions, its reactions to sensory stimuli, and its control of movements. They offer an account of perception as the combination of prediction and observation: the brain builds internal models that describe what should happen and then combines this prediction with reports from the sensory system to form a belief. Considering the brain's control of movements, and variations despite biomechanical similarities among old and young, healthy and unhealthy, and humans and other animals, Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi review evidence suggesting that motor commands reflect an economic decision made by our brain weighing reward and effort. This evidence also suggests that the brain prefers to receive a reward sooner than later, devaluing or discounting reward with the passage of time; then as the value of the expected reward changes in the brain with the passing of time (because of development, disease, or evolution), the shape of our movements will also change. The internal models formed by the brain provide the brain with an essential survival skill: the ability to predict based on past observations. The formal concepts presented by Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi offer a way to describe how representations are formed, what structure they have, and how the theoretical concepts can be tested.},

abstract = {Our inner ear is equipped with a set of linear accelerometers, the otolith organs, that sense the inertial accelerations experienced during self-motion. However, as Einstein pointed out nearly a century ago, this signal would by itself be insufficient to detect our real movement, because gravity, another form of linear acceleration, and self-motion are sensed identically by otolith afferents. To deal with this ambiguity, it was proposed that neural populations in the pons and midline cerebellum compute an independent, internal estimate of gravity using signals arising from the vestibular rotation sensors, the semicircular canals. This hypothesis, regarding a causal relationship between firing rates and postulated sensory contributions to inertial motion estimation, has been directly tested here by recording neural activities before and after inactivation of the semicircular canals. We show that, unlike cells in normal animals, the gravity component of neural responses was nearly absent in canal-inactivated animals. We conclude that, through integration of temporally matched, multimodal information, neurons derive the mathematical signals predicted by the equations describing the physics of the outside world.},

abstract = {Although we know that the process of saccade target selection is reflected in the activity of sensory-motor neurons within saccade executive centers, the description of this process at the neural level has yet to fully account for all selection outcomes. The current study sought to determine how neuronal activity in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SC) determines correct saccade target selection by examining the activity of visuomovement neurons during both correct and error trials of monkeys performing a relatively difficult visual conjunction search task. We found that a stimulus presented in a neuron's response field, but not foveated, was associated with greater activity if it was the search target instead of a distractor, indicating that SC neurons could represent stimulus identity. Nevertheless, activity was greater when a saccade was made to a stimulus than when it was not, further implicating these neurons in selecting the saccade goal. Together with the related observation that, when the target fell in their response fields, SC neurons discharged significantly more if the monkey correctly selected it instead of a distractor, these results suggest that visual stimuli are selected when these neurons reach a critical activation level. Our findings show that the outcome of all visual search trials, regardless of the stimulus being selected, is predicted by SC neuronal activity.},

For slow-tracking eye movements, the activity of Purkinje cells in the ventral paraflocculus of the cerebellum is known to be correlated with eye velocity and acceleration. Here we show that the complex temporal pattern of the firing frequency that occurs during the ocular following response elicited by movements of a large visual scene can be reconstructed by an inverse-dynamics representation, which uses the position, velocity and acceleration of eye movements. Further analysis reveals that the velocity and acceleration components can provide appropriate dynamic drive signals to ocular motor neurons, whereas the position component often has the wrong polarity.

abstract = {Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) of the macular area of the retina is the major cause of severe vision loss in adults. In CNV, after choriocapillaries initially penetrate Bruch's membrane (BrM), invading vessels may regress or expand (CNV initiation). Next, during Early and Late CNV, the expanding vasculature usually spreads in one of three distinct patterns: in a layer between BrM and the retinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE or Type 1 CNV), in a layer between the RPE and the photoreceptors (sub-retinal or Type 2 CNV) or in both loci simultaneously (combined pattern or Type 3 CNV). While most studies hypothesize that CNV primarily results from growth-factor effects or holes in BrM, our three-dimensional simulations of multi-cell model of the normal and pathological maculae recapitulate the three growth patterns, under the hypothesis that CNV results from combinations of impairment of: 1) RPE-RPE epithelial junctional adhesion, 2) Adhesion of the RPE basement membrane complex to BrM (RPE-BrM adhesion), and 3) Adhesion of the RPE to the photoreceptor outer segments (RPE-POS adhesion). Our key findings are that when an endothelial tip cell penetrates BrM: 1) RPE with normal epithelial junctions, basal attachment to BrM and apical attachment to POS resists CNV. 2) Small holes in BrM do not, by themselves, initiate CNV. 3) RPE with normal epithelial junctions and normal apical RPE-POS adhesion, but weak adhesion to BrM (e.g. due to lipid accumulation in BrM) results in Early sub-RPE CNV. 4) Normal adhesion of RBaM to BrM, but reduced apical RPE-POS or epithelial RPE-RPE adhesion (e.g. due to inflammation) results in Early sub-retinal CNV. 5) Simultaneous reduction in RPE-RPE epithelial binding and RPE-BrM adhesion results in either sub-RPE or sub-retinal CNV which often progresses to combined pattern CNV. These findings suggest that defects in adhesion dominate CNV initiation and progression.},

abstract = {In order to study the cooperation of peripheral motor subsystems, the degree of curvature of human saccades along cardinal (right, up, left, down) and oblique directions was computed from an extensive set of experimental data. Our curvature measure allows comparison of fast and slow saccade trajectories elicited in different experimental conditions, independent of the speed of execution. Although we found clear and consistent subject-specific differences, the most common pattern in oblique visually-guided (i.e., fast) saccades reflected early dominance of the horizontal velocity signal as expressed in saccade trajectories curving away from the horizontal axis. Plots of curvature against direction yielded consistent idiosyncratic patterns with periodical increases and decreases in saccade curvature which were largely independent of saccade amplitude. At the cardinal axes, mean saccade curvature was generally less, but rarely entirely absent, and fitted smoothly into the curvature pattern of neighbouring quadrants. Memory-guided saccades, which have been shown earlier to be considerably slower than visually-guided saccades and to be more variable in their dynamic properties, showed a strikingly similar dependence of curvature on saccade direction, although some small but consistent differences were noticed. This finding suggests that saccade curvature is determined by mechanisms residing in the final common pathway for both saccade types. The curvature data were compared with quantitative predictions from three different models for the generation of oblique saccades. By quantifying the curvature of human saccades and thereby revealing the shortcomings of these models, the present paper documents new constraints with which future models of the saccadic system must comply and allows certain suggestions on how these might be developed.},

abstract = {Previous theoretical investigations of the three-dimensional (3-D) angular vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) have separately modeled realistic coordinate transformations in the direct velocity path or the nontrivial problems of converting angular velocity into a 3-D orientation command. We investigated the physiological and behavioral implications of combining both approaches. An ideal VOR was simulated using both a plant model with head-fixed eye muscle actions (standard plant) and one with muscular position dependencies that facilitate Listing's law (linear plant). In contrast to saccade generation, stabilization of the eye in space required a 3-D multiplicative (tensor) interaction between the various components of velocity and position in both models: in the indirect path of the standard plant version, but also in the direct path of the linear plant version. We then incorporated realistic nonorthogonal coordinate transformations (with the use of matrices) into both models. Each now malfunctioned, predicting ocular drift/retinal destabilization during and/or after the head movement, depending on the plant version. The problem was traced to the standard multiplication tensor, which was only defined for right-handed, orthonormal coordinates. We derived two solutions to this problem: 1) separating the brain stem coordinate transformation into two (sensory and motor) transformations that reordered and "undid" the nonorthogonalities of canals and muscle transformations, thus ensuring orthogonal brain stem coordinates, or 2) computing the correct tensor components for velocity-orientation multiplication in arbitrary coordinates. Both solutions provided an ideal VOR. A similar problem occurred with partial canal or muscle damage. Altering a single brain stem transformation was insufficient because the resulting coordinate changes rendered the multiplication tensor inappropriate. This was solved by either recomputing the multiplication tensor, or recomputing the appropriate internal sensory or motor matrix to normalize and reorthogonalize the brain stem. In either case, the multiplication tensor had to be correctly matched to its coordinate system. This illustrates that neural coordinate transformations affect not only serial/parallel projections in the brain, but also lateral projections associated with computations within networks/nuclei. Consequently, a simple progression from sensory to motor coordinates may not be optimal. We hypothesize that the VOR uses a dual coordinate transformation (i.e., both sensory and motor) to optimize intermediate brain stem coordinates, and then sets the appropriate internal tensor for these coordinates. We further hypothesize that each of these processes should optimally be capable of specific, experimentally identifiable adjustments for motor learning and recovery from damage.},

The inputs to the network were a 2-D, eye-centered, topographic map of Gaussian visual receptive fields and an efference copy of eye position in 6-dimensional, push-pull "neural integrator" coordinates. The output was an eye orientation displacement command in similar coordinates appropriate to drive brain stem burst neurons. The network learned to generate accurate, kinematically correct saccades, including the eye orientation-dependent tilts in saccade motor error commands required to match saccade trajectories to their visual input. Our analysis showed that the hidden units developed complex, eye-centered visual receptive fields, widely distributed fixed-vector motor commands, and "gain field"-like eye position sensitivities. The latter evoked subtle adjustments in the relative motor contributions of each hidden unit, thereby rotating the population motor vector into the correct correspondence with the visual target input for each eye orientation: a distributed population mechanism for the visuomotor reference frame transformation. These findings were robust; there was little variation across networks with between 9 and 49 hidden units. Because essentially the same observations have been reported in the visuomotor transformations of the real oculomotor system, as well as other visuomotor systems (although interpreted elsewhere in terms of other models) we suggest that the mechanism for visuomotor reference frame transformations identified here is the same solution used in the real brain.},

abstract = {There is general agreement that saccades are guided to their targets by means of a motor error signal, which is produced by a local feedback circuit that calculates the difference between desired saccadic amplitude and an internal copy of actual saccadic amplitude. Although the superior colliculus (SC) is thought to provide the desired saccadic amplitude signal, it is unclear whether the SC resides in the feedback loop. To test this possibility, we injected muscimol into the brain stem region containing omnipause neurons (OPNs) to slow saccades and then determined whether the firing of neurons at different sites in the SC was altered. In 14 experiments, we produced saccadic slowing while simultaneously recording the activity of a single SC neuron. Eleven of the 14 neurons were saccade-related burst neurons (SRBNs), which discharged their most vigorous burst for saccades with an optimal amplitude and direction (optimal vector). The optimal directions for the 11 SRBNs ranged from nearly horizontal to nearly vertical, with optimal amplitudes between 4 and 17 degrees. Although muscimol injections into the OPN region produced little change in the optimal vector, they did increase mean saccade duration by 25 to 192.8\% and decrease mean saccade peak velocity by 20.5 to 69.8\%. For optimal vector saccades, both the acceleration and deceleration phases increased in duration. However, during 10 of 14 experiments, the duration of deceleration increased as fast as or faster than that of acceleration as saccade duration increased, indicating that most of the increase in duration occurred during the deceleration phase. SRBNs in the SC changed their burst duration and firing rate concomitantly with changes in saccadic duration and velocity, respectively. All SRBNs showed a robust increase in burst duration as saccadic duration increased. Five of 11 SRBNs also exhibited a decrease in burst peak firing rate as saccadic velocity decreased. On average across the neurons, the number of spikes in the burst was constant. There was no consistent change in the discharge of the three SC neurons that did not exhibit bursts with saccades. Our data show that the SC receives feedback from downstream saccade-related neurons about the ongoing saccades. However, the changes in SC firing produced in our study do not suggest that the feedback is involved with producing motor error. Instead, the feedback seems to be involved with regulating the duration of the discharge of SRBNs so that the desired saccadic amplitude signal remains present throughout the saccade.},

abstract = {A fundamental question in primate neurobiology is to understand to what extent motor behaviors are driven by shared neural signals that also support conscious perception or by independent subconscious neural signals dedicated to motor control. Although it has clearly been established that cortical areas involved in processing visual motion support both perception and smooth pursuit eye movements, it remains unknown whether the same or different sets of neurons within these structures perform these two functions. Examination of the trial-by-trial variation in human perceptual and pursuit responses during a simultaneous psychophysical and oculomotor task reveals that the direction signals for pursuit and perception are not only similar on average but also co-vary on a trial-by-trial basis, even when performance is at or near chance and the decisions are determined largely by neural noise. We conclude that the neural signal encoding the direction of target motion that drives steady-state pursuit and supports concurrent perceptual judgments emanates from a shared ensemble of cortical neurons.},

These results were compared with those of 17 age-matched healthy subjects. Smooth pursuit was elicited with a step-ramp target movement with randomized horizontal directions and velocities of 10 degrees/sec and 30 degrees/sec. In the first 20-msec pursuit, velocity was 22\% lower toward the side of the cerebellar lesion than away from it and 16\% lower in the period 80 to 100 msec (normal differences, 2\% and 3\%). Later (200-300 msec), the ipsiversive/contraversive difference was smaller, but pursuit velocity in both directions was significantly lower in patients than in normals. No lesion affected the floccular region and/or the nodulus/uvula. Five lesions extended so far medially that they could have affected the medial deep cerebellar nucleus (fastigial nucleus). The remaining five were in the lateral hemisphere in areas previously considered uninvolved in pursuit generation. Our findings prove that the cerebellum participates in human pursuit initiation and that lesions in the lateral cerebellum possibly affect smooth pursuit.},

abstract = {Purkinje cells in the flocculus and ventral paraflocculus were studied in tasks designed to distinguish predictive versus visually guided mechanisms of smooth pursuit. A sum-of-sines task allowed studies of complex predictive pursuit. A perturbation task examined visually driven pursuit during unpredictable right-angle changes in target direction. A gap task examined pursuit that was maintained when the target was turned off. Neural activity patterns were quantified using multi-linear models with sensitivities to the position, velocity, and acceleration of both motor output (eye motion) and visual input (retinal slip). During the sum-of-sines task, neural responses led eye motion by an average of 12 ms, a value larger than the 9-ms transmission delay between flocculus stimulation and eye motion. This suggests that flocculus/paraflocculus neurons drove pursuit along predictable sum-of-sines trajectories. In contrast, neural responses led eye motion by an average of only 2 ms during the perturbation task and by 6 ms during the gap task. These values suggest a follow-up role during tasks more heavily dependent on visual processing. Activity in all three tasks was explained primarily by sensitivities to eye position and velocity. Eye acceleration played a minor role during ongoing pursuit, although its influence on firing rate increased during the high accelerations following unexpected changes in target motion. Retinal slip had a relatively small influence on responses during pursuit. This was particularly true for the sum-of-sines and gap tasks where predictive control eliminated any consistent retinal-slip signals that might have been used to drive the eye. Surprisingly, the influence of retinal slip did not increase appreciably during unpredictable perturbations in target direction that generated large amounts of retinal slip. Thus although visual control signals are needed in varying amounts during the three pursuit tasks, they have been converted to motor control signals by the time they leave the flocculus/paraflocculus system. Individual neurons showed a remarkable constancy in eye-sensitivity direction across tasks that indicated direct links to oculomotor neurons. However, some neurons showed changes in sensitivity magnitude that suggested changes in control strategy for different tasks. Magnitude differences were largest for the perturbation task. We conclude that the flocculus/paraflocculus system plays a major role in driving predictive pursuit. It also processes visually driven control signals that originate in other brain regions after a slight delay.},

abstract = {Eye-head gaze pursuit-related activity was recorded in rostral portions of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (rNRTP) in alert macaques. The head was unrestrained in the horizontal plane, and macaques were trained to pursue a moving target either with their head, with the eyes stationary in the orbits, or with their eyes, with their head voluntarily held stationary in space. Head-pursuit-related modulations in rNRTP activity were observed with some cells exhibiting increases in firing rate with increases in head-pursuit frequency. For many units, this head-pursuit response appeared to saturate at higher frequencies (>0.6 Hz). The response phase re:peak head-pursuit velocity formed a continuum, containing cells that could encode head-pursuit velocity and those encoding head-pursuit acceleration. The latter cells did not exhibit head position-related activity. Sensitivities were calculated with respect to peak head-pursuit velocity and averaged 1.8 spikes/s/deg/s. Of the cells that were tested for both head- and eye-pursuit-related activity, 86\% exhibited responses to both head- and eye-pursuit and therefore carried a putative gaze-pursuit signal. For these gaze-pursuit units, the ratio of head to eye response sensitivities averaged approximately 1.4. Pursuit eccentricity seemed to affect head-pursuit response amplitude even in the absence of a head position response per se. The results indicated that rNRTP is a strong candidate for the source of an active head-pursuit signal that projects to the cerebellum, specifically to the target-velocity and gaze-velocity Purkinje cells that have been observed in vermal lobules VI and VII.},

abstract = {The rotation axis for each of the six extraocular muscles was determined in four eyes from three perfused rhesus monkeys. Measurements of the locations of muscle insertions and origins were made in the stereotaxic reference frame with the x-y plane horizontal and the x-z plane sagittal. The computed rotation axes of the horizontal recti were close to being in the x-z plane at an angle of about 15 degrees to the z axis. The rotation axes of the vertical recti and the obliques were close to being in the x-y plane at an angle of about 30 degrees to the y axis. In five alert rhesus monkeys, we simultaneously recorded extraocular motoneuron activity and eye position in three dimensions (3D). The activity of 51 motoneuron axons was obtained from the oculomotor (n=34), trochlear (n=11), and abducens nerve (n=6) during spontaneous eye movements. To extend the torsional range of eye position, the animals were also put in different static roll positions, which induced ocular counterroll without dynamic vestibular stimulation. Periods of 100 ms during fixation or slow eye movements (<10 degrees/s) were chosen for analysis. For each motoneuron, a multiple linear regression was performed between firing frequency and 3D eye position, expressed as a rotation vector, in both stereotaxic and Listing's reference frame. The direction with the highest correlation coefficient (average R=0.94+/-0.07 SD) was taken as the on-direction. Each unit's activity could be unequivocally attributed to one particular muscle. On-directions for each motoneuron were confined to a well-defined cone in 3D. Average on-directions of motoneurons differed significantly from the corresponding anatomically determined muscle rotation axes expressed in the stereotaxic reference frame (range of deviations: 11.9 degrees to 29.0 degrees). This difference was most pronounced for the vertical recti and oblique muscles. The muscle rotation axes of the vertical rectus pair and the oblique muscle pair form an angle of 58.3 degrees, whereas the corresponding angle for paired motoneuron on-directions was 105.6 degrees. On-directions of motoneurons were better aligned with the on-directions of semicircular canal afferents (range of deviation: 9.4-18.9 degrees) or with the anatomically determined sensitivity vectors of the semicircular canals (range of deviation: 3.9-15.9 degrees) than with the anatomically determined muscle rotation axes, but significant differences remain to be explained. The on-directions of motoneurons were arranged symmetrically to Listing's plane, in the sense that the torsional components for antagonistically paired muscles were almost equal, but of opposite sign. Thus, the torsional components of motoneuron on-directions cancel when eye movements are confined to Listing's plane. This arrangement simplifies the neuronal transformations for conjugate head-fixed voluntary eye movements, while the approximate alignment with the semicircular canal reference frame is optimal for generating compensatory eye movements.},

abstract = {Much controversy remains about the site of learning and memory for vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) adaptation in spite of numerous previous studies. One possible explanation for VOR adaptation is the flocculus hypothesis, which assumes that this adaptation is caused by synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar cortex. Another hypothesis is the model proposed by Lisberger that assumes that the learning that occurs in both the cerebellar cortex and the vestibular nucleus is necessary for VOR adaptation. Lisberger's model is characterized by a strong positive feedback loop carrying eye velocity information from the vestibular nucleus to the cerebellar cortex. This structure contributes to the maintenance of a smooth pursuit driving command with zero retinal slip during the steady-state phase of smooth pursuit with gain 1 or during the target blink condition. Here, we propose an alternative hypothesis that suggests that the pursuit driving command is maintained in the medial superior temporal (MST) area based on MST firing data during target blink and during ocular following blank, and as a consequence, we assume a much smaller gain for the positive feedback from the vestibular nucleus to the cerebellar cortex. This hypothesis is equivalent to assuming that there are two parallel neural pathways for controlling VOR and smooth pursuit: a main pathway of the semicircular canals to the vestibular nucleus for VOR, and a main pathway of the MST-dorsolateral pontine nuclei (DLPN)-flocculus/ventral paraflocculus to the vestibular nucleus for smooth pursuit. First, we theoretically demonstrate that this parallel control-pathway theory can reproduce the various firing patterns of horizontal gaze velocity Purkinje cells in the flocculus/ventral paraflocculus dependent on VOR in the dark, smooth pursuit, and VOR cancellation as reported in Miles et al. at least equally as well as the gaze velocity theory, which is the basic framework of Lisberger's model. Second, computer simulations based on our hypothesis can stably reproduce neural firing data as well as behavioral data obtained in smooth pursuit, VOR cancellation, and VOR adaptation, even if only plasticity in the cerebellar cortex is assumed. Furthermore, our computer simulation model can reproduce VOR adaptation automatically based on a heterosynaptic interaction model between parallel fiber inputs and climbing fiber inputs. Our results indicate that different assumptions about the site of pursuit driving command maintenance computationally lead to different conclusions about where the learning for VOR adaptation occurs. Finally, we propose behavioral and physiological experiments capable of discriminating between these two possibilities for the site of pursuit driving command maintenance and hence for the sites of learning and memory for VOR adaptation.},

abstract = {We studied the effects on smooth pursuit eye movements of ablation of the dorsal cerebellar vermis (lesions centered on lobules VI and VII) in three monkeys in which the cerebellar nuclei were spared. Following the lesion the latencies to pursuit initiation were unchanged. Monkeys showed a small decrease (up to 15\%) in gain during triangular-wave tracking. More striking were changes in the dynamic properties of pursuit as determined in the open-loop period (the 1st 100 ms) of smooth tracking. Changes included a decrease in peak eye acceleration (e.g., in one monkey from approximately 650 degrees /s(2), prelesion to approximately 220-380 degrees /s(2), postlesion) and a decrease in the velocity at the end of the open-loop period [e.g., in another monkey from a gain (eye velocity/target velocity at 100 ms of tracking) of 0.93, prelesion to 0.53, postlesion]. In individual monkeys, the pattern of deficits in the open-loop period of pursuit was usually comparable to that of saccades, especially when comparing the changes in the acceleration of pursuit to the changes in the velocity of saccades. These findings support the hypothesis that saccades and the open-loop period of pursuit are controlled by the cerebellar vermis in an analogous way. Saccades could be generated by eye velocity commands to bring the eyes to a certain position and pursuit by eye acceleration commands to bring the eyes toward a certain velocity. On the other hand, changes in gain during triangular-wave tracking did not correlate with either the saccade or the open-loop pursuit deficits, implying different contributions of the oculomotor vermis to the open loop and to the sustained portions of pursuit tracking. Finally, in a pursuit adaptation paradigm (x0.5 or x2, calling for a halving or doubling of eye velocity, respectively) intact animals could adaptively adjust eye acceleration in the open-loop period. The main pattern of change was a decrease in peak acceleration for x0.5 training and an increase in the duration of peak acceleration for x2 training. Following the lesion in the oculomotor vermis, this adaptive capability was impaired. In conclusion, as for saccades, the oculomotor vermis plays a critical role both in the immediate on-line and in the short-term adaptive control of pursuit.},

abstract = {Saccades are eye movements that are used to foveate targets rapidly and accurately. Their amplitude must be adjusted continually, throughout life, to compensate for movement inaccuracies due to maturation, pathology, or aging. One possible locus for such saccade adaptation is the superior colliculus (SC), the relay for cortical commands to the premotor brain stem generator for saccades. However, previous stimulation and recording studies have disagreed as to whether saccade adaptation occurs up- or downstream of the SC. Therefore we have reexamined the behavior of SC burst neurons during saccade adaptation under conditions that were optimized to produce the biggest possible change in neuronal activity. We show that behavioral adaptation of saccade amplitude was associated with significant increases or decreases, in the number of spikes in the burst and/or changes in the shape of the movement field in 35 of 43 SC neurons tested. Of the 35, 29 had closed movement fields and 14 were classified indeterminate because the movement field could not be definitively diagnosed. Changes in the number of spikes occurred gradually during adaptation and resulted from correlated changes in burst lead and duration without consistent changes in peak burst rate. These data indicate that the great majority of SC neurons show a change in discharge in association with saccade amplitude adaptation. Based on these and previous results, we speculate that the site for saccade adaptation resides in the SC or that the SC is the final common pathway for adaptive changes that occur elsewhere in the saccade system.},

abstract = {Movement duration is an integral component of motor control, but nearly all extant optimization models of motor planning prefix duration instead of explaining it. Here we propose a new optimization principle that predicts movement duration. The model assumes that the brain attempts to minimize movement duration under the constraint of meeting an accuracy criterion. The criterion is task and context dependent but is fixed for a given task and context. The model determines a unique duration as a trade-off between speed (time optimality) and accuracy (acceptable endpoint scatter). We analyzed the model for a linear motor plant, and obtained a closed-form equation for determining movement duration. By solving the equation numerically with specific plant parameters for the eye and arm, we found that the model can reproduce saccade duration as a function of amplitude (the main sequence), and arm-movement duration as a function of the ratio of target distance to size (Fitts's law). In addition, it explains the dependency of peak saccadic speed on amplitude and the dependency of saccadic duration on initial eye position. Furthermore, for arm movements, the model predicts a scaling relationship between peak velocity and distance and a reduction in movement duration with a moderate increase in viscosity. Finally, for a linear plant, our model predicts a neural control signal identical to that of the minimum-variance model set to the same movement duration. This control signal is a smooth function of time (except at the endpoint), in contrast to the discontinuous bang-bang control found in the time-optimal control literature. We suggest that one aspect of movement planning, as revealed by movement duration, may be to assign an endpoint accuracy criterion for a given task and context.},

To further analyze the signals carried by the FPA, we examined the activity of pursuit-related neurons recorded from a discrete region near the arcuate spur during a variety of oculomotor tasks. Pursuit neurons showed direction tuning with a wide range of preferred directions and a mean full width at half-maximum of 129 degrees. Analysis of latency using the "receiver operating characteristic" to compare responses to target motion in opposite directions showed that the directional response of 58\% of FPA neurons led the initiation of pursuit, while 19\% led by 25 ms or more. Analysis of neuronal responses during pursuit of a range of target velocities revealed that the sensitivity to eye velocity was larger during the initiation of pursuit than during the maintenance of pursuit, consistent with two components of firing related to image motion and eye motion. FPA neurons showed correlates of two behavioral features of pursuit documented in prior reports. 1) Eye acceleration at the initiation of pursuit declines as a function of the eccentricity of the moving target. FPA neurons show decreased firing at the initiation of pursuit in parallel with the decline in eye acceleration. This finding is consistent with prior suggestions that the FPA plays a role in modulating the gain of visual-motor transmission for pursuit. 2) A stationary eccentric cue evokes a smooth eye movement opposite in direction to the cue and enhances the pursuit evoked by subsequent target motions. Many pursuit neurons in the FPA showed weak, phasic visual responses for stationary targets and were tuned for the positions about 4 degrees eccentric on the side opposite to the preferred pursuit direction. However, few neurons (12\%) responded during the preparation or execution of saccades. The responses to the stationary target could account for the behavioral effects of stationary, eccentric cues. Further analysis of the relationship between firing rate and retinal position error during pursuit in the preferred and opposite directions failed to provide evidence for a large contribution of image position to the firing of FPA neurons. We conclude that FPA processes information in terms of image and eye velocity and that it is functionally separate from the saccadic frontal eye fields, which processes information in terms of retinal image position.},

In the present experiments, double-target stimuli consisted of two identical targets moving in opposite directions along the preferred axis of pursuit for the neuron under study for 200 ms, followed by the continued motion for 800 ms of one target chosen randomly. Among the neurons that showed directional modulation during pursuit, recordings revealed three groups. The majority (32/60) showed responses that were intermediate to, and statistically different from, the responses to either target presented alone. Another large group (22/60) showed activity that was statistically indistinguishable from the response to the target moving in the preferred (n = 15) or opposite (n = 7) direction of the neuron under study. The minority (6/60) showed statistically higher firing during averaging pursuit than for either target presented singly. We conclude that many pursuit-related neurons in the frontal pursuit area (FPA) carry signals related to the motor output during averaging pursuit, while others encode the motion of one target or the other. Microstimulation with 200-ms trains of pulses at 50 microA while monkeys performed the same double-target tasks biased the averaging eye velocity in the direction of evoked eye movements during fixation. The effect of stimulation was compared with the predictions of three different models that placed the site of vector averaging upstream from, at, or downstream from the sites where the FPA regulates the gain of pursuit. The data were most consistent with a site for pursuit averaging downstream from the gain control, both for double-target stimuli that presented motion in opposite directions and in orthogonal directions. Thus the recording and stimulation data suggest that the FPA is both downstream and upstream from the sites of vector averaging. We resolve this paradox by suggesting that the site of averaging is really downstream from the site of gain control, while feedback of the eye velocity command from the brain stem and/or cerebellum is responsible for the firing of FPA neurons in relation to the averaged eye velocity. We suggest that eye velocity feedback allows FPA neurons to continue firing during accurate tracking, when image motion is small, and that the persistent output from the FPA is necessary to keep the internal gain of pursuit high and permit accurate pursuit.},

Such movements are based on a phylogenetically recent cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathway that has evolved in parallel with foveal vision. Recent work has shown that a network of several cerebrocortical areas directs attention to objects of interest moving in three dimensions and reconstructs the trajectory of the target in extrapersonal space, thereby integrating various sources of multimodal sensory and efference copy information, as well as cognitive influences such as prediction. This cortical network is the starting point of a set of parallel cerebrofugal projections that use different parts of the dorsal pontine nuclei and the neighboring rostral nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis as intermediate stations to feed two areas of the cerebellum, the flocculus-paraflocculus and the posterior vermis, which make mainly complementary contributions to the control of smooth pursuit. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {It is well established that the head and eye velocity axes do not always align during compensatory vestibular slow phases. It has been shown that the eye velocity axis systematically tilts away from the head velocity axis in a manner that is dependent on eye-in-head position. The mechanisms responsible for producing these axis tilts are unclear. In this model-based study, we aimed to determine whether muscle pulleys could be involved in bringing about these phenomena. The model presented incorporates semicircular canals, central vestibular pathways, and an ocular motor plant with pulleys. The pulleys were modeled so that they brought about a rotation of the torque axes of the extraocular muscles that was a fraction of the angle of eye deviation from primary position. The degree to which the pulleys rotated the torque axes was altered by means of a pulley coefficient. Model input was head velocity and initial eye position data from passive and active yaw head impulses with fixation at 0 degrees, 20 degrees up and 20 degrees down, obtained from a previous experiment. The optimal pulley coefficient required to fit the data was determined by calculating the mean square error between data and model predictions of torsional eye velocity. For active head impulses, the optimal pulley coefficient varied considerably between subjects. The median optimal pulley coefficient was found to be 0.5, the pulley coefficient required for producing saccades that perfectly obey Listing's law when using a two-dimensional saccadic pulse signal. The model predicted the direction of the axis tilts observed in response to passive head impulses from 50 ms after onset. During passive head impulses, the median optimal pulley coefficient was found to be 0.21, when roll gain was fixed at 0.7. The model did not accurately predict the alignment of the eye and head velocity axes that was observed early in the response to passive head impulses. We found that this alignment could be well predicted if the roll gain of the angular vestibuloocular reflex was modified during the initial period of the response, while pulley coefficient was maintained at 0.5. Hence a roll gain modification allows stabilization of the retinal image without requiring a change in the pulley effect. Our results therefore indicate that the eye position-dependent velocity axis tilts could arise due to the effects of the pulleys and that a roll gain modification in the central vestibular structures may be responsible for countering the pulley effect.},

abstract = {1. Intracortical microstimulation was used to localize and define the smooth and saccadic eye movement subregions of the frontal eye field (FEF) and the supplementary eye field (SEF) in nine hemispheres of six Cebus apella monkeys and to map the hand/arm areas in the dorsal premotor area and other adjacent areas in five hemispheres of three C. apella monkeys. Monkeys were anesthetized during experiments with Telazol, a dissociative agent that has no significant effect on microstimulation-induced eye movement parameters (current threshold, velocity, and duration). The functional subregions were defined with the use of low threshold current (< or = 50 microA). Electrically elicited eye movements were videotaped and quantified. The two types of eye movements were clearly distinguished by their significantly different duration and velocity (P < 0.0001) and their different responses to long stimulus trains. 2. The saccadic subregion of the FEF in Cebus monkeys is in the same location as in macaque monkeys (Walker's areas 8a and 45). Most of the functional and anatomic characteristics of the saccadic subregion of Cebus are the same as those reported in the saccadic FEF subregion of macaque monkeys. 3. A subregion in which only smooth eye movements were evoked was found in the posterior shoulder of the superior arcuate sulcus near its medial tip. A band of inexcitable cortex separated the SEF and this smooth eye movement subregion of the FEF. This supports the proposal that the smooth eye movement subregion is independent of the SEF but is analogous to the saccadic subregion of the FEF. The existence of two subregions of the FEF was further confirmed by single-unit recording results. It is proposed that the smooth eye movement subregion in Cebus monkeys may be comparable with the one described in macaque monkeys. 4. Both saccadic and smooth eye movements were also reliably evoked in the SEF in each hemisphere studied. This result strongly indicates that the SEF is concerned with not only saccadic eye movements, as previously reported, but also with smooth (pursuit) eye movements.},

abstract = {Current theories of eye-head gaze shifts deal only with one-dimensional motion, and do not touch on three-dimensional (3-D) issues such as curvature and Donders' laws. I show that recent 3-D data can be explained by a model based on ideas that are well established from one-dimensional studies, with just one new assumption: that the eye is driven toward a 3-D orientation in space that has been chosen so that Listing's law of the eye in head will hold when the eye-head movement is complete. As in previous, one-dimensional models, the eye and head are feedback-guided and the commands specifying desired eye position eye pass through a neural "saturation" so as to stay within the effective oculomotor range. The model correctly predicts the complex, 3-D trajectories of the head, eye in space, and eye in head in a variety of saccade tasks. And when it moves repeatedly to the same target, varying the contributions of eye and head, the model lands in different eye-in-space positions, but these positions differ only in their cyclotorsion about the line of sight, so they all point that line at the target-a behavior also seen in real eye-head saccades. Between movements the model obeys Listing's law of the eye in head and Donders' law of the head on torso, but during certain gaze shifts involving large torsional head movements, it shows marked, 8 degrees deviations from Listing's law. These deviations are the most important untested predictions of the theory. Their experimental refutation would sink the model, whereas confirmation would strongly support its central claim that the eye moves toward a 3-D position in space chosen to obey Listing's law and, therefore, that a Listing operator exists upstream from the eye pulse generator.},

This feature is necessary for computing rotary motion, because order makes a difference to the combined effect of two rotations. It has therefore been proposed that there are non-commutative operators in the brain circuits that deal with rotations, including motor circuits that steer the eyes, head and limbs, and sensory circuits that handle spatial information. This idea is controversial: studies of eye and head control have revealed behaviours that are consistent with non-commutativity in the brain, but none that clearly rules out all commutative models. Here we demonstrate non-commutative computation in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. We show that subjects rotated in darkness can hold their gaze points stable in space, correctly computing different final eye-position commands when put through the same two rotations in different orders, in a way that is unattainable by any commutative system.},

abstract = {1. Do neural computations in premotor circuits mirror the physical properties of the systems they control? In 1987, Tweed and Vilis showed that oculomotor theories where a neural integrator converts eye angular velocity commands into position commands cannot be correct, because angular position is not the integral of angular velocity. Recently Schnabolk and Raphan proposed that an angular velocity integrator is nevertheless used to generate tonic commands in the oculomotor system. Here we test the Schnabolk-Raphan (S-R) model against Tweed and Vilis's quaternion (Q) model of the velocity to position transformation. 2. The S-R model predicts large (up to 7 degrees) transient (approximately 700 ms) deviations ("blips") in torsional eye position during attempted horizontal and vertical saccades. The Q model predicts no blips. Search coil recordings of saccades by 7 normal human subjects showed no large blips. 3. For approximately 200 saccades by each subject, we plotted the area under the torsional blip versus the product of saccade eccentricity and magnitude. According to the S-R model, this graph should form a straight line with slope 1.00. According to the Q model, the slope should be zero. Measured slopes averaged 0.016 (range -0.073 to 0.061) for saccade targets at 20 degrees eccentricity and 0.040 (range 0.004-0.076) for targets at 40 degrees. 4. No parameter change can significantly improve the S-R model, but lowering one parameter eradicates the tiny inaccuracy in the Q model. We show that the fundamental reason for the S-R model's failure is its use of a commutative controller to steer a noncommutative plant.},

abstract = {1. This paper develops three-dimensional models for the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the internal feedback loop of the saccadic system. The models differ qualitatively from previous, one-dimensional versions, because the commutative algebra used in previous models does not apply to the three-dimensional rotations of the eye. 2. The hypothesis that eye position signals are generated by an eye velocity integrator in the indirect path of the VOR must be rejected because in three dimensions the integral of angular velocity does not specify angular position. Computer simulations using eye velocity integrators show large, cumulative gaze errors and post-VOR drift. We describe a simple velocity to position transformation that works in three dimensions. 3. In the feedback control of saccades, eye position error is not the vector difference between actual and desired eye positions. Subtractive feedback models must continuously adjust the axis of rotation throughout a saccade, and they generate meandering, dysmetric gaze saccades. We describe a multiplicative feedback system that solves these problems and generates fixed-axis saccades that accord with Listing's law. 4. We show that Listing's law requires that most saccades have their axes out of Listing's plane. A corollary is that if three pools of short-lead burst neurons code the eye velocity command during saccades, the three pools are not yoked, but function independently during visually triggered saccades. 5. In our three-dimensional models, we represent eye position using four-component rotational operators called quaternions. This is not the only algebraic system for describing rotations, but it is the one that best fits the needs of the oculomotor system, and it yields much simpler models than do rotation matrix or other representations. 6. Quaternion models predict that eye position is represented on four channels in the oculomotor system: three for the vector components of eye position and one inversely related to gaze eccentricity and torsion. 7. Many testable predictions made by quaternion models also turn up in models based on other mathematics. These predictions are therefore more fundamental than the specific models that generate them. Among these predictions are 1) to compute eye position in the indirect path of the VOR, eye or head velocity signals are multiplied by eye position feedback and then integrated; consequently 2) eye position signals and eye or head velocity signals converge on vestibular neurons, and their interaction is multiplicative.},

abstract = {For any given location and velocity of a point target, there are infinitely many different eye velocities that the pursuit system could use to track the target perfectly. Three-dimensional recordings of eye position and velocity in 8 normal human subjects showed that the system chooses the unique tracking velocity that keeps eye position vectors (a particular mathematical representation of three-dimensional eye orientation) confined to a single plane i.e. pursuit obeysListing's law. One advantage of this strategy over other possible ones, such as choosing the smallest eye velocity compatible with perfect tracking, is that it permits continuous pursuit without accumulation of ocular torsion. For nonpoint targets, there is at most one eye velocity compatible with perfect retinal image stabilisation, and the optimal velocity may not fit Listing's law; we observed small but consistent deviations from the law during pursuit of rotating line targets.},

This paper examines the visual and motor consequences of this rule. Although L2 is a generalization of Listing's original, monocular law, it does not follow from current theories of the latter's function, which involve minimizing muscle work or optimizing certain aspects of retinal image flow. This study shows that a new optimization strategy that combines stereo vision with motor efficiency does explain L2, and describes the predictions of this new theory. Contrary to recent suggestions in the literature, L2 does not ensure single vision of lines orthogonal to the visual plane, but rather reduces cyclodisparity of the visual plane itself; and L2 does not arise because a single, conjugate angular velocity command is sent to both eyes, but actually requires that the two eyes rotate with different speeds and axes when scanning an isovergence surface. This study shows that L2 is compatible with a 1-D control system for vergence alone (because horizontal and torsional vergence are yoked) and a 3-D system for combined, head-fixed saccades and vergence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous study (Vaghefi et al. 2012) we described a 3D computer model that used finite element modeling to capture the structure and function of the ocular lens. This model accurately predicted the steady state properties of the lens including the circulating ionic and fluid fluxes that are believed to underpin the lens internal microcirculation system. In the absence of a blood supply, this system brings nutrients to the core of the lens and removes waste products faster than would be achieved by passive diffusion alone. Here we test the predictive properties of our model by investigating whether it can accurately mimic the experimentally measured changes to lens steady-state properties induced by either depolarising the lens potential or reducing Na+ pump rate.

METHODS: To mimic experimental manipulations reported in the literature, the boundary conditions of the model were progressively altered and the model resolved for each new set of conditions. Depolarisation of lens potential was implemented by increasing the extracellular [K+], while inhibition of the Na+ pump was stimulated by utilising the inherent temperature sensitivity of the pump and changing the temperature at which the model was solved.

RESULTS: Our model correctly predicted that increasing extracellular [K+] depolarizes the lens potential, reducing and then reversing the magnitude of net current densities around the lens. While lowering the temperature reduced Na+ pump activity and caused a reduction in circulating current, it had a minimal effect on the lens potential, a result consistent with published experimental data.

CONCLUSION: We have shown that our model is capable of accurately simulating the effects of two known experimental manipulations on lens steady-state properties. Our results suggest that the model will be a valuable predictive tool to support ongoing studies of lens structure and function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that in the absence of a blood supply, the ocular lens operates an internal microcirculation system. This system delivers nutrients, removes waste products and maintains ionic homeostasis in the lens. The microcirculation is generated by spatial differences in membrane transport properties; and previously has been modelled by an equivalent electrical circuit and solved analytically. While effective, this approach did not fully account for all the anatomical and functional complexities of the lens. To encapsulate these complexities we have created a 3D finite element computer model of the lens.

METHODS: Initially, we created an anatomically-correct representative mesh of the lens. We then implemented the Stokes and advective Nernst-Plank equations, in order to model the water and ion fluxes respectively. Next we complemented the model with experimentally-measured surface ionic concentrations as boundary conditions and solved it.

RESULTS: Our model calculated the standing ionic concentrations and electrical potential gradients in the lens. Furthermore, it generated vector maps of intra- and extracellular space ion and water fluxes that are proposed to circulate throughout the lens. These fields have only been measured on the surface of the lens and our calculations are the first 3D representation of their direction and magnitude in the lens.

CONCLUSION: Values for steady state standing fields for concentration and electrical potential plus ionic and fluid fluxes calculated by our model exhibited broad agreement with observed experimental values. Our model of lens function represents a platform to integrate new experimental data as they emerge and assist us to understand how the integrated structure and function of the lens contributes to the maintenance of its transparency.},

abstract = {The durations and trajectories of our saccadic eye movements are remarkably stereotyped. We have no voluntary control over these properties but they are determined by the movement amplitude and, to a smaller extent, also by the movement direction and initial eye orientation. Here we show that the stereotyped durations and trajectories are optimal for minimizing the variability in saccade endpoints that is caused by motor noise. The optimal duration can be understood from the nature of the motor noise, which is a combination of signal-dependent noise favoring long durations, and constant noise, which prefers short durations. The different durations of horizontal vs. vertical and of centripetal vs. centrifugal saccades, and the somewhat surprising properties of saccades in oblique directions are also accurately predicted by the principle of minimizing movement variability. The simple and sensible principle of minimizing the consequences of motor noise thus explains the full stereotypy of saccadic eye movements. This suggests that saccades are so stereotyped because that is the best strategy to minimize movement errors for an open-loop motor system.},

abstract = {It is well established that a localized population of neurons in the motor map of the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) drives a saccadic eye-head gaze shift. However, there is controversy as to how the brainstem saccade burst generators decode the SC activity. We focus on eye-movement generation by comparing two competing schemes from the recent literature that are both supported by neurophysiological evidence: the vector-averaging scheme versus the vector summation model. Whereas the former contains at least four nonlinearities to explain visuomotor planning and saccade execution, the latter relies predominantly on linear operations. We have demonstrated that the summation model accounts for the nonlinear main sequence of saccade kinematics, and predicted that this results from a spatial gradient in temporal burst profiles of SC cells: rostral cells have higher peak-firing rates and shorter burst durations than caudal cells. Yet, the number of spikes in their saccade-related bursts is identical. In contrast, the averaging model does not predict such activity profiles. We now also show that by incorporating the concept of predictive remapping in the spatial updating of saccade sequences, the phenomenon of target averaging in double-stimulation experiments, and the occurrence of goal-directed, but highly curved saccades in the double-step paradigm, can all be explained by the same linear summation mechanism. We argue that the linear model is more in line with neurophysiological data, while relying on fewer ad-hoc assumptions than the nonlinear vector-averaging scheme.},

abstract = {The superior colliculus in the monkey contains a topographically organized representation of the target in its upper layers and saccade-related activity in its deeper layers. Since collicular movement fields are quite large, a considerable region of the colliculus is active whenever a saccade is made. We have modelled the collicular role in saccade generation based on the idea, proposed earlier in the literature, that each movement cell causes a movement tendency in the direction of the external world point which it represents in the collicular map. The model is organized as follows: An anisotropic logarithmic mapping transforms retinal coordinates into collicular coordinates. A two-dimensional Gaussian function describes the spatial extent of the movement-related activity in the deeper layers. An efferent mapping function specifies how the direction and the size of the movement contribution of each colliculus neuron depends on its location and its firing rate. The total saccade is the vector sum of the individual cell contributions. This very simple model (seven fixed parameters) has been used to simulate metrical properties of saccades: in response to visual targets; in response to electrical stimulation in one colliculus, and after a colliculus lesion. Model performance appears to be remarkably realistic but cannot account for some border effects and responses to double stimulation. Suggestions on how the model can be improved and extended will be presented.},

abstract = {We have shown earlier in a neural network study of the saccadic system, how retinal error an efference copy signal of eye position may give rise to distributed coding of target position in craniocentric coordinates at one level, and of motor error in oculocentric coordinates at another stage. In the present paper, the coding properties of units in the model's two hidden layers were investigated, in order to understand at a more abstract level, how they handle their inputs and how the two different target representations at subsequent stages emerge. In particular, we hoped to understand better how craniocentric and oculocentric target representations can be constructed by merging a retino-topically coded visual signal and recruitment-coded eye position information. In the first hidden layer, we found that inputs from both visual and oculomotor signals were nicely matched in showing similar directional selectivity. Computationally, the net input of each hidden unit can be represented by the dot product between a fixed sensitivity vector, embodied by the unit's input weights, and the two-dimensional input signal encoded by the population activity. Scaling of the resulting total net input signal through a sigmoidal nonlinearity then yields the activity of the hidden unit. The fact that the sensitivity vectors for retinal and oculomotor signals in the first hidden layer were roughly aligned and matched in amplitude is the basic underlying principle for a rough craniocentric coding at this level. Units in the second hidden layer represent motor error. This can similarly be understood on the basis of the previously mentioned dot product characterization of the hidden unit's connectivity. The combined process of tuned projection and compression by the unit's sigmoidal nonlinearity also captures the gain-field properties of units in the first hidden layer. Our study suggests that the approach underlying the present analysis of an artificial network may be a useful tool to describe real networks and to allow a direct comparison of simulated and neurophysiological data.

abstract = {In this report, we provide the first quantitative characterization of the relationship between the spike train dynamics of medial rectus oculomotoneurons (OMNs) and eye movements during conjugate and disconjugate saccades. We show that a simple, first-order model (i.e., containing eye position and velocity terms) provided an adequate model of neural discharges during both on and off-directed conjugate saccades, while a second-order model, which included a decaying slide term, significantly improved the ability to fit neuronal responses by approximately 10\% (P<0.05). To understand how the same neurons drove disconjugate eye movements, we evaluated whether sensitivities estimated during conjugate saccades could be used to predict responses during disconjugate saccades. For the majority of neurons (68\%), a conjugate-based model failed, and instead neurons preferentially encoded the position and velocity of the ipsilateral eye. Similar to our previous results with abducens motoneurons, we also found that position and velocity sensitivities of OMNs decreased with increasing velocity, and the simulated population drive of OMNs during disconjugate saccades was less (approximately 10\%) than during conjugate saccades. Taken together, our results provide evidence that the activation of the antagonist, as well as agonist, motoneuron pools must be considered to understand the neural control of horizontal eye movements across different oculomotor behaviors. Moreover, we propose that the undersampling of smaller motoneurons (e.g., nontwitch) was likely to account for the missing drive observed during disconjugate saccades; these cells are thought to be more specialized for vergence movements and thus could provide the additional input required to command disconjugate eye movements.},

abstract = {When we look between objects located at different depths the horizontal movement of each eye is different from that of the other, yet temporally synchronized. Traditionally, a vergence-specific neuronal subsystem, independent from other oculomotor subsystems, has been thought to generate all eye movements in depth. However, recent studies have challenged this view by unmasking interactions between vergence and saccadic eye movements during disconjugate saccades. Here, we combined experimental and modeling approaches to address whether the premotor command to generate disconjugate saccades originates exclusively in "vergence centers." We found that the brain stem burst generator, which is commonly assumed to drive only the conjugate component of eye movements, carries substantial vergence-related information during disconjugate saccades. Notably, facilitated vergence velocities during disconjugate saccades were synchronized with the burst onset of excitatory and inhibitory brain stem saccadic burst neurons (SBNs). Furthermore, the time-varying discharge properties of the majority of SBNs (>70\%) preferentially encoded the dynamics of an individual eye during disconjugate saccades. When these experimental results were implemented into a computer-based simulation, to further evaluate the contribution of the saccadic burst generator in generating disconjugate saccades, we found that it carries all the vergence drive that is necessary to shape the activity of the abducens motoneurons to which it projects. Taken together, our results provide evidence that the premotor commands from the brain stem saccadic circuitry, to the target motoneurons, are sufficient to ensure the accurate control shifts of gaze in three dimensions.},

abstract = {Current models assign a crucial role to the deep layers of the Superior Colliculus (SC) in the dynamic feedback control of saccadic eye movements. However, if the SC is to be part of the local feedback loop for saccades, it is expected that the movement-related firing patterns of deep layer SC cell maintain a fixed relation with the instantaneous saccade trajectory, regardless of the conditions that evoked the saccade. In this paper we provide three different lines of evidence, suggesting that the movement activity of SC burst cells may change as a function of the sensory conditions evoking the saccade. First, it is shown that bimodal (visual-auditory) stimulation may markedly enhance (up to about 350\%) or suppress (on average down to 70\%) SC motor bursts when compared to the activity for unimodal visual stimulation. Second, the movement activity associated with auditory-evoked saccades appeared to be reduced by almost 60\% relative to visually-evoked saccades of the same metrics (tested in one monkey). However, for both paradigms, these relatively large changes in movement activity went without a concomitant change in the saccade properties. Third, a short-term saccadic adaptation paradigm produced saccades with a smaller amplitude (gain about 0.7) upon presentation of the adapting visual stimulus. However, we found that the movement-related activity of SC burst cells did not change in this paradigm. These findings suggest that the SC cells do neither encode saccade kinematics, nor the precise components of the saccade vector. Rather, we propose that the motor SC issues a crude desired eye displacement signal to the brainstem that is transformed into the appropriate movement signals by downstream or parallel mechanisms.},

abstract = {Recently, we proposed an ensemble-coding scheme of the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) in which, during a saccade, each spike emitted by each recruited SC neuron contributes a fixed minivector to the gaze-control motor output. The size and direction of this 'spike vector' depend exclusively on a cell's location within the SC motor map (Goossens and Van Opstal, in J Neurophysiol 95: 2326-2341, 2006). According to this simple scheme, the planned saccade trajectory results from instantaneous linear summation of all spike vectors across the motor map. In our simulations with this model, the brainstem saccade generator was simplified by a linear feedback system, rendering the total model (which has only three free parameters) essentially linear. Interestingly, when this scheme was applied to actually recorded spike trains from 139 saccade-related SC neurons, measured during thousands of eye movements to single visual targets, straight saccades resulted with the correct velocity profiles and nonlinear kinematic relations ('main sequence properties' and 'component stretching'). Hence, we concluded that the kinematic nonlinearity of saccades resides in the spatial-temporal distribution of SC activity, rather than in the brainstem burst generator. The latter is generally assumed in models of the saccadic system. Here we analyze how this behaviour might emerge from this simple scheme. In addition, we will show new experimental evidence in support of the proposed mechanism.},

abstract = {The present study investigated the contribution of the presence of a visual signal at the saccade goal on saccade trajectory deviations and measured distractor-related inhibition as indicated by deviation away from an irrelevant distractor. Performance in a prosaccade task where a visual target was present at the saccade goal was compared to performance in an anti- and memory-guided saccade task. In the latter two tasks no visual signal is present at the location of the saccade goal. It was hypothesized that if saccade deviation can be ultimately explained in terms of relative activation levels between the saccade goal location and distractor locations, the absence of a visual stimulus at the goal location will increase the competition evoked by the distractor and affect saccade deviations. The results of Experiment 1 showed that saccade deviation away from a distractor varied significantly depending on whether a visual target was presented at the saccade goal or not: when no visual target was presented, saccade deviation away from a distractor was increased compared to when the visual target was present. The results of Experiments 2-4 showed that saccade deviation did not systematically change as a function of time since the offset of the target. Moreover, Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that the disappearance of the target immediately increased the effect of a distractor on saccade deviations, suggesting that activation at the target location decays very rapidly once the visual signal has disappeared from the display.},

abstract = {The properties of the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) when the axis of rotation is behind the eyes and fixation of a near target is required were studied in the monkey. The magnitude of VOR gain in each eye was found to be above 1.0 and near the ideal value for stabilizing a retinal image. Evidence that this large VOR gain was not visually mediated was provided by the observations that no reduction in gain and no phase lag were observed at high frequencies of head rotation (2 Hz), large gain was observed in the dark, and large gain was observed within 10-20 ms of the start of head rotation. The magnitude of VOR gain was found to increase with increasing radius of head rotation and also to increase with decreasing target distance. When the distances from the two eyes to the target were different the instantaneous velocities and VOR gains of the eyes were also different. The dependence on radius of rotation indicates that the VOR is mediated by a combination of otolith and canal inputs. A general model for otolith-canal interaction is proposed in which VOR gain is based on a computation of target location relative to the head.

abstract = {1. The locus of activity within the superior colliculus (SC) is related to the desired displacement of the eye. Current hypotheses suggest that the location of this locus of activity determines the amplitude of the saccade and that the level of activity at this locus determines eye velocity. We present evidence that suggests that, although the locus determines the amplitude of the saccade, the level of activity in the colliculus encodes dynamic motor error (the difference between desired and current eye displacement). 2. We categorized 86 neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus of two rhesus monkeys by their activity in relation to the end of saccadic eye movements. In 36\% of the cells (n = 31), activity was completely cut off by the end of the saccade (clipped cells). For 53\% of cells (n = 46), the major burst of activity ceased by the end of the saccade, but activity continued for 30-100 ms after the end of the movement (partially clipped cells). The remaining 10\% of the cells (n = 9) had no clear burst of activity (unclipped cells) but rather had activity that increased gradually before the saccade and then slowly decreased for up to 100 ms after the saccade. These categories were part of a continuum of cell types rather than discrete classes of cells. 3. We first determined whether this new categorization of cells revealed a special relation between the discharge of clipped and partially clipped cells and saccadic amplitude and peak velocity. As expected, we found a steady increase in spike count as saccadic amplitude increased up to the center of the movement field, and an increase in peak spike discharge as peak velocity increased up to a maximum radial eye velocity. Variability in the cell discharge was substantially greater than the variability of saccadic amplitude or peak velocity. We concluded that these single point or averaged measures did not reveal any new functional relationship of these cells. 4. We then examined the relationship of the temporal pattern of discharge of clipped and partially clipped cells to instantaneous changes in radial error and radial velocity. There was a monotonic decay in spike discharge with declining radial error. In contrast, there was a complex, multivalued relationship between spike discharge and radial velocity; collicular cells produced two different values of spike discharge for the same velocity, one during acceleration and the other during deceleration of the eye during a saccade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The cerebral cortex must have access to an eye position signal, as humans can report passive changes in eye position in total darkness, and visual responses in many cortical areas are modulated by eye position. The source of this signal is unknown. Here we demonstrate a representation of eye position in monkey primary somatosensory cortex, in the representation of the trigeminal nerve, near cells with a tactile representation of the contralateral brow. The neurons have eye position signals that increase monotonically with increasing orbital eccentricity from near the center of gaze, with directionally selectivity tuned in a Gaussian manner. All directions of eye position are represented in a single hemisphere. The signal is proprioceptive, because it can be obliterated by anesthetizing the contralateral orbit. It is not related to foveal or peripheral visual stimulation, and it represents the position of the eye in the head and not the angle of gaze in space.},

abstract = {The ability to orient and navigate through the terrestrial environment represents a computational challenge common to all vertebrates. It arises because motion sensors in the inner ear, the otolith organs, and the semicircular canals transduce self-motion in an egocentric reference frame. As a result, vestibular afferent information reaching the brain is inappropriate for coding our own motion and orientation relative to the outside world. Here we show that cerebellar cortical neuron activity in vermal lobules 9 and 10 reflects the critical computations of transforming head-centered vestibular afferent information into earth-referenced self-motion and spatial orientation signals. Unlike vestibular and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons, where a mixture of responses was observed, Purkinje cells represent a homogeneous population that encodes inertial motion. They carry the earth-horizontal component of a spatially transformed and temporally integrated rotation signal from the semicircular canals, which is critical for computing head attitude, thus isolating inertial linear accelerations during navigation.},

abstract = {Two patients with spinocerebellar degeneration made abnormally slow horizontal refixations. One patient produced quick phases of nystagmus with identical maximum velocities, suggesting her refixations were abnormal saccades and not voluntary pursuit movements. In response to double target jumps, neither patient showed an obligatory refractory period after each saccade; they responded to every target movement after one reaction time. Their slow refixations were not preprogrammed since they could be modified in flight. To reconcile these observations with normal saccadic behavior, we hypothesized a neural network that made saccades by driving the eyes to an orbital position rather than preprogramming a distance for movement. Computer simulation of this model produced both realistically appearing normal saccades and, when appropriately "lesioned" to simulate a loss of saccadic "burst" neurons in the pontine reticular formation, slow saccades that could be modified in flight.},

abstract = {To explore the visible world, human beings and other primates often rely on gaze shifts. These are coordinated movements of the eyes and head characterized by stereotypical metrics and kinematics. It is possible to determine the rules that the effectors must obey to execute them rapidly and accurately and the neural commands needed to implement these rules with the help of optimal control theory. In this study, we demonstrate that head-fixed saccades and head-free gaze shifts obey a simple physical principle, "the minimum effort rule." By direct comparison with existing models of the neural control of gaze shifts, we conclude that the neural circuitry that implements the minimum effort rule is one that uses inhibitory cross talk between independent eye and head controllers.},

@article{Dean1995,
abstract = {Clinical and experimental data indicate that damage to the cerebellar vermis results in permanent loss of saccadic accuracy. Models of saccade production therefore need to provide a role for the cerebellum. It has been proposed that the vermis adjusts the gain of the saccadic internal feedback loop in response to information about the amplitude of the intended saccade. A model of how the fastigial nuclei (through which vermal output is channelled) influence brainstem saccadic circuitry to achieve this effect was constructed in three stages. (1) The brainstem was represented by a version of Robinson's internal feedback model, which relates excitatory burst neuron discharge to horizontal saccade dynamics. (2) The original model was lesioned to simulate the effects of bilateral inactivation of the fastigial nuclei, namely slow hypermetric saccades. This required reducing the synaptic weight of the internal feedback pathway, and lowering the gain of the excitatory burst neurons. The resultant brainstem-only model served as a preparation for testing the effects of neuronal discharge patterns within the fastigial nuclei. (3) These discharge patterns were simulated using measurements from recent electrophysiological studies. It was found that saccadic accuracy and normal dynamics were restored in the model if the simulated burst from neurons in the contralateral fastigial nucleus were subtracted from the feedback signal (i.e. added to the command signal) early in the saccade, and the burst from neurons in the ipsilateral fastigial nucleus were added to the feedback signal later in the saccade. This pattern corresponds to the observed timing of neuronal bursts in the fastigial nuclei, and accounts qualitatively for the effects of unilateral stimulation and inactivation of both the fastigial nuclei and the cerebellar vermis. This method of producing accurate saccades also contributes to time optimal control, by increasing both saccadic acceleration and deceleration. Appropriate timing of burst onset and duration in the fastigial nuclei is essential for these roles. Evidence concerning the effects of cerebellar damage on fast movements of other parts of the body suggests that the cerebellum may use similar strategies for controlling a wide range of simple movements.},

@article{Dean1994,
abstract = {Abstract Saccadic accuracy requires that the control signal sent to the motor neurons must be the right size to bring the fovea to the target, whatever the initial position of the eyes (and corresponding state of the eye muscles). Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that the basic machinery for generating saccadic eye movements, located in the brainstem, is not accurate: learning to make accurate saccades requires cerebellar circuitry located in the posterior vermis and fastigial nucleus. How do these two circuits interact to achieve adaptive control of saccades? A model of this interaction is described, based on Kawato's principle of feedback-error-learning. Its three components were (1) a simple controller with no knowledge of initial eye position, corresponding to the superior colliculus; (2) Robinson's internal feedback model of the saccadic burst generator, corresponding to preoculomotor areas in the brain-stem; and (3) Albus's Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMK), a neural net model of the cerebellum. The connections between these components were (I) the simple feedback controller passed a (usually inaccurate) command to the pulse generator, and (2) a copy of this command to the CMAC; (3) the CMAC combined the copy with information about initial eye position to (4) alter the gain on the pulse generator's internal feedback loop, thereby adjusting the size of burst sent to the motor neurons. (5) If the saccade were inaccurate, an error signal from the feedback controller adjusted the weights in the CMAC. It was proposed that connection (2) corresponds to the mossy fiber projection from superior colliculus to oculomotor vermis via the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and connection (5) to the climbing fiber projection from superior colliculus to the oculomotor vermis via the inferior olive. Plausible initialization values were chosen so that the system produced hypometric saccades (as do human infants) at the start of learning, and position-dependent hypermetric saccades when the cerebellum was removed. Simulations for horizontal eye movements showed that accurate saccades from any starting position could be learned rapidly, even if the error signal conveyed only whether the initial saccade were too large or too small. In subsequent tests the model adapted realistically both to simulated weakening of the eye muscles, and to intrasaccadic displacement of the target, thereby mimicking saccadic plasticity in adults. The architecture of the model may therefore offer a functional explanation of hitherto mysterious tectocerebellar projections, and a framework for investigating in greater detail how the cerebellum adaptively controls saccadic accuracy.},

@article{Ebadzadeh2003,
abstract = {A control circuit is proposed to model the command of saccadic eye movements. Its wiring is deduced from a mathematical constraint, i.e. the necessity, for motor orders processing, to compute an approximate inverse function of the bio-mechanical function of the moving plant, here the bio-mechanics of the eye. This wiring is comparable to the anatomy of the cerebellar pathways. A predicting element, necessary for inversion and thus for movement accuracy, is modeled by an artificial neural network whose structure, deduced from physical constraints expressing the mechanics of the eye, is similar to the cell connectivity of the cerebellar cortex. Its functioning is set by supervised reinforcement learning, according to learning rules aimed at reducing the errors of pointing, and deduced from a differential calculation. After each movement, a teaching signal encoding the pointing error is distributed to various learning sites, as is, in the cerebellum, the signal issued from the inferior olive and conveyed to various cell types by the climbing fibers. Results of simulations lead to predict the existence of a learning site in the glomeruli. After learning, the model is able to accurately simulate saccadic eye movements. It accounts for the function of the cerebellar pathways and for the final integrator of the oculomotor system. The novelty of this model of movement control is that its structure is entirely deduced from mathematical and physical constraints, and is consistent with general anatomy, cell connectivity and functioning of the cerebellar pathways. Even the learning rules can be deduced from calculation, and they reproduce long term depression, the learning process which takes place in the dendritic arborization of the Purkinje cells. This approach, based on the laws of mathematics and physics, appears thus as an efficient way of understanding signal processing in the motor system.},

@article{Gancarz1999a,
abstract = {Multiple brain learning sites are needed to calibrate the accuracy of saccadic eye movements. This is true because saccades can be made reactively to visual cues, attentively to visual or auditory cues, or planned in response to memory cues using visual, parietal, and prefrontal cortex, as well as superior colliculus, cerebellum, and reticular formation. The organization of these sites can be probed by displacing a visual target during a saccade. The resulting adaptation typically shows incomplete and asymmetric transfer between different tasks. A neural model of saccadic system learning is developed to explain these data, as well as data about saccadic coordinate changes.},

@article{Lefevre1998,
abstract = {We investigate the role that superior colliculus (SC) and cerebellum (CBLM) might play in controlling saccadic eye movements. Even though strong experimental evidence argues for an important role for the CBLM, the most recent models of the saccadic system have relied mostly on the SC for the dynamic control of saccades. In this study, we propose that saccades are controlled by two parallel pathways, one including the SC and the other including the CBLM. In this model, both SC and CBLM provide part of the drive to the saccade. Furthermore, the CBLM receives direct feedback from the brain stem and keeps track of the residual motor error, so that it can issue appropriate commands to compensate for incorrect heading and to end the movement when the target has been foveated. We present here a distributed model that produces realistic saccades and accounts for a great deal of neurophysiological data.},

@article{Quaia1999,
abstract = {Experimental evidence indicates that the superior colliculus (SC) is important but neither necessary nor sufficient to produce accurate saccadic eye movements. Furthermore both clinical and experimental evidence points to the cerebellum as an indispensable component of the saccadic system. Accordingly, we have devised a new model of the saccadic system in which the characteristics of saccades are determined by the cooperation of two pathways, one through the SC and the other through the cerebellum. Both pathways are influenced by feedback information: the feedback determines the decay of activity for collicular neurons and the timing of the activation for cerebellar neurons. We have modeled three types of cells (burst, buildup, and fixation neurons) found in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus. We propose that, from the point of view of motor execution, the burst neurons and the buildup neurons are not functionally distinct with both providing a directional drive to the brain stem circuitry. The fixation neurons determine the onset of the saccade by disfacilitating the omnipause neurons in the brain stem. Excluding noise-related variations, the ratio of the horizontal to the vertical components of the collicular drive is fixed throughout the saccade (i.e., its direction is fixed); the duration of the drive is such that it always would produce hypermetric movements. The cerebellum plays three roles: first, it provides an additional directional drive, which improves the acceleration of the eyes; second, it keeps track of the progress of the saccade toward the target; and third, it ends the saccade by choking off the collicular drive. The drive provided by the cerebellum can be adjusted in direction to exert a directional control over the saccadic trajectory. We propose here a control mechanism that incorporates a spatial displacement integrator in the cerebellum; under such conditions, we show that a partial directional control arises automatically. Our scheme preserves the advantages of several previous models of the saccadic system (e.g., the lack of a spatial-to-temporal transformation between the SC and the brain stem; the use of efference copy feedback to control the saccade), without incurring many of their drawbacks, and it accounts for a large amount of experimental data.},
