Control
=======

This is still a work in progress, but is meant to be a flexible library for simulating, controlling and 
animating dynamical systems within different environments.

The idea is that the user should only specify the different components (plant, environment, controller etc.), 
or use existing ones, and have the simulation, animation and data collection taken care of by the system.
It contains some common control and estimation algorithms like <b> PID, LQR, LQG, </b> and the <b>kalman filter</b>.

The basics architecture is there along with simulation, animation and some classes for dynamical systems 
and environments, but more components, tests, examples and documentation are needed!
